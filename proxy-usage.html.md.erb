<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

Buildpacks can use proxies via the `http_proxy` and/or `https_proxy` environment variables. These should be set to the proxy hostname and/or port.

These can be set via the [manifest.yml](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html#env-block) file or `cf set-env`.

All of the buildpacks will automatically utilize these proxy environment variables correctly. If any of them contact the internet during staging, it will be through the proxy host.
The binary buildpack will not use a proxy because it does not use the internet at all during staging.

  env:
    http_proxy: http://proxy-site.com:3000
    https_proxy: https://proxy-site.com:3003

__Note:__ Whilst many applications will use the `http_proxy` and `https_proxy`
environment variables at runtime, this is entirely dependent on your
application, the buildpack does not add any extra functionality to make proxies
work at runtime.
