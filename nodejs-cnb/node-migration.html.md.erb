title: Migrating to Node.js Cloud Native Buildpack
owner: Buildpacks
---

This topic describes how to prepare your Node or JavaScript apps to use the Node.js Cloud Native Buildpack (CNB)
instead of the Cloud Foundry-only Node.js buildpack.


##<a id='install-processes'></a> Install Processes:
With the new Node.js Cloud Native Buildpack, the installation commands
that we choose to build an apps `node_modules` have changed
as follows:

  - We assume that all of the following are updated and in agreement
    before an app is `cf pushed`
    - `package.json`
    - `package-lock.json` (optional)
    - `node_modules` (optional)
    - `npm-cache` (optional)
    - `yarn.lock` (optional)


As a result we require that apps that contain `node_modules` or `npm-cache` must contain
all of the dependencies required for a successful `npm` or `yarn` install.

For additional details on how the installation process is chosen of this buildpack see
[ Node.js Cloud Native Buildpack installation process](../nodejs-cnb#npm-installation-process).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Due to the modular nature of CNB,
the new Node.js buildpack does not currently
include certain external integration helpers, such as those for APM agents.
</p>

##<a id='buildpack-ordering'></a> Buildpack Ordering
The compatibility layer generated by `cnb2cf` imposes some additional
constraints on multi-buildpacks builds.  If a CF-compatible CNB is used during
multi-buildpack builds. All subsequent buildpacks must also be CF-compatible CNB.
In the example `cf push` below all buildpacks between
`compat-cn_buildpack_1` and `compat-cn_buildpack_n` must be a CF-compatible CNB.

```
  cf push -b bpack_1 -b bpack_2 -b compat-cn_bpack_1 ... -b compat-cn_bpack_n
```

##<a id='migration-guide'></a> Migration Guide:

###<a id='vendored-apps-with-NPM'></a> Vendored Apps with NPM

Vendored app now must vendor ALL dependencies listed in `package.json`:

+ **Using `node_modules`:** Validate that all modules are vendored into the `node_modules` by the following:

      ```
         npm list
      ```

    If there are missing dependencies listed, this app will fail to build.
    Re-vendor by running the following in the root of your app:

      ```
          npm install <your preferred flags>
      ```

+ **Using `npm-cache`:** This is a newly added

     ```
        npm ci --cache npm-cache
     ```

###<a id='online-apps-npm'></a> Online Apps with NPM

To deploy online apps on NPM with the Node.js CNB:

+ **Remove partially vendored components:**
Online apps must not contain either a `node_modules` or `npm-cache`
directory in the root directory of the app.
Remove these before running `cf-push`.

+ **Make sure all dependencies are met:** Apps must contain all required dependencies
  after an install.
  If you provide a `package.json` and all modules cannot be installed
  the subsequent `npm list` check will cause the build to fail.

###<a id='yarn-apps'></a> Yarn Apps

To deploy online apps on NPM with the Node.js CNB:

+ `yarn.lock` must agree with package.json

Yarn apps will have dependencies installed from the `yarn.lock` file.
This differs from the behavior of the Node.js Buildpack which installs
dependencies from the `package.json` file.

To avoid discrepancies in installed
packages, generate an up to date `yarn.lock` file before running a `cf push`
using:

```
yarn install <your preferred flags>
```
