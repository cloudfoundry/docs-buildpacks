title: Migrating to Node.js Cloud Native Buildpack
owner: Buildpacks

## What is a Shimmed Buildpack?
A shimmed buildpack is a bundled collection of <b>Cloud Native Buildpacks</b> (CNBs),
and a <b>Compatibility Layer</b> to allow CNBs to run on Cloud Foundry.

#### Cloud Native Buildpacks:
Cloud Native Buildpacks are an improved way to deploy application using modular
buildpacks to allow for improved performance, informative logging, and ease
configuration.  For more about the Cloud Native Buildpacks Project see [Cloud
Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/)

#### Compatibility Layer:
This is a layer that is generated by the `cnb2cf` tool. It mediates API
differences between Cloud Native Buildpacks and Cloud Foundry Buildpacks.
For more info see [cnb2cf](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cnb2cf)

## Summary of changes:

### Install Processes:
With the new Node.js Cloud Native Buildpack, the installation commands
that we choose to build an applications `node_modules` have changed
as follows:

  - We assume that all of the following are updated and in agreement
    before an application is `cf pushed`
    - `package.json`
    - `package-lock.json` (optional)
    - `node_modules` (optional)
    - `npm-cache` (optional)

As a result we require that apps that contain `node_modules` or `npm-cache` must contain
all of the dependencies required for a successfull `npm` or `yarn` install.

For additional details on how the installation process is chosen of this buildpack see
[ Node.js Cloud Native Buildpack installation process](../nodejs-cnb#npm-installation-process).

### Integrations
Due to the modular nature of CNB, the new Node.js buildpack does not currently
include certain external integration helpers, such as those for APM agents. It
has been difficult to manage and test these integrations, and we plan to shift
towards modular integration CNBs that are maintained outside the project by
integration authors and platform vendors.

### Buildpack ordering
The compatibility layer generated by `cnb2cf` imposes some additional
constraints on multi-buildpacks builds.  If a Shimmed Buildpack is used during
multibuildpack builds. All subsequent buildpacks must also be Shimmed
Buildpacks.  In the example `cf push` below all buildpacks between
`shimmed_buildpack_1` and `shimmed_buildpack_n` must be Shimmed Buildpacks.

```
  cf push -b bpack_1 -b bpack_2 -b shimmed_bpack_1 ... -b shimmed_bpack_n
```

## Migration Guide:
### Vendored Applications with NPM
  Vendored application now must vendor ALL dependencies listed in `package.json`
#### Using `node_modules`
Validate that all modules are vendored into the `node_modules` by the following:
```
  npm list
```
If there are missing dependencies listed, this application will fail to build.
Simply re-vendor by running the following in the root of your application:

```
  npm install <your prefered flags>
```

#### Using `npm-cache`
This is a newly added
```
npm ci --cache npm-cache
```

### Online applications with NPM
#### Remove partially vendored components
Online applications must not contain either a `node_modules` or `npm-cache`
directory in the root directory of the application. Remove these before running
`cf-push`

#### Make sure all dependencies are met
Applications must contain all required dependencies after an install.
If you provide a `package.json` and all modules cannot be installed
the subsequent `npm list` check will cause the build to fail

### Yarn Applications
These should not require any changes and should work with
