You can use this information to deploy a Ruby on Rails app to Cloud Foundry.

##<a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

In order to deploy a sample Ruby on Rails app, you must have the following:

- Cloud Foundry deployment
- [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](../../operating/cf-cli/install-cf-cli.html)
- Cloud Foundry username and password with **Space Developer** [permissions](../../concepts/roles.html#roles). See your [Org Manager](../../concepts/roles.html#roles) if you require permissions.

##<a id='clone'></a>Step 1: Clone the app

Run the following command to create a local copy of the cf-sample-app-rails:

```console
git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/cf-sample-app-rails.git
```

The newly created directory contains a `manifest.yml` file, which assists CF with deploying the app.
See [Deploying with Application Manifests](../../devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html#minimal-manifest) for more information.

##<a id='login'></a>Step 2: Log in and target the API endpoint

1. Run the following terminal command to log in and target the API endpoint of your deployment.  <%= vars.api_endpoint_book %>

    ```console
    cf login -a YOUR-API-ENDPOINT
    ```

1. Use your credentials to log in, and to select a [Space and Org](../../concepts/roles.html).

##<a id='service'></a>Step 3: Create a service instance

Run the following terminal command to create a PostgreSQL service instance for the sample app.

```console
cf create-service postgresql-10-odb standalone rails-postgres
```

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-service postgresql-10-odb standalone rails-postgres
Creating service rails-postgres in org YOUR-ORG / space development as clouduser<span>@</span>example.com....
OK
</pre>

The service instance is `rails-postgres`. It uses the `postgresql-10-odb` service and the `standalone` plan.
For more information about the `postgresql-10-odb` service, see
[Crunchy PostgreSQL](https://www.crunchydata.com/products/crunchy-postgresql-for-cloud-foundry/).


##<a id='deploy'></a>Step 4: Deploy the app

Make sure you are in the `cf-sample-app-rails` directory. Run the following command to deploy the app:

```console
cf push cf-sample-app-rails
```

This command creates a URL route to your application in the form `HOST.DOMAIN`.
In this example, `HOST` is `cf-sample-app-rails`. Administrators specify the `DOMAIN`.

For example, for the `DOMAIN` `<%= vars.app_domain %>`, running the previous command
creates the URL `cf-sample-app-rails.<%= vars.app_domain %>`.

The following example shows the terminal output when deploying the `cf-sample-app-rails`. `cf push` uses the instructions in the manifest file to create the app, create and bind the route, and upload the app. It then follows the information in the manifest to start one instance of the app with 256M of RAM. After the app starts, the output displays the health and status of the app.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push cf-sample-app-rails
Using manifest file ~/workspace/cf-sample-app-rails/manifest.yml

Creating app cf-sample-app-rails in org my-rog / space dev as clouduser@example.com...

</pre>

If you want to view log activity while the app deploys, launch a new terminal window and
run <code>cf logs cf-sample-app-rails</code>.

To avoid security exposure, verify that you migrate your apps and custom buildpacks to use
the <code>cflinuxfs4</code> stack based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish). The <code>cflinuxfs3</code>
stack is based on Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver), which reaches end of standard support in April 2023.

##<a id='bind'></a> Step 5: Bind the service instance

1. Run the following command to bind the service instance to the sample app.
Once bound, environment variables are stored that allow the app to connect to the
service after a `cf push`, `cf restage`, or `cf restart` command.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf bind-service cf-sample-app-rails rails-postgres
    Binding service rails-postgres to app cf-sample-app-rails in org my-org / space dev
    OK
    TIP: Use 'cf restage cf-sample-app-rails' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
    </pre>

1. Run the following command to restage the sample app.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf restage cf-sample-app-rails
    </pre>

1. Run the following command to verify the service instance is bound to the sample app.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf services
    Getting services in org my-org / space dev
    OK
    name             service             plan          bound apps            last operation
    rails-postgres   postgresql-10-odb   standalone    cf-sample-app-rails   create succeeded
    </pre>


##<a id='verify'></a>Step 6: Verify the app

Verify that your app is running by browsing to the URL generated in the output of the previous step.
In this example, go to `cf-sample-app-rails.<%=vars.app_domain%>` and verify that the app is running.

For more information, see the [Pushing an App](../../devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html) topic.

### Test a deployed app

Use the cf <%=vars.dev_console_2%> to review information and administer your app and your account. For example, you could edit the `manifest.yml` file to increase the number of app instances from 1 to 3 or redeploy the app with a new app name.

### Manage your app with the cf CLI

Run `cf help` to view a complete list of commands and run `cf help COMMAND` for detailed information about a specific command. For more information about using the cf CLI, refer to the cf CLI topics, especially the <%=vars.cli_v6%> topic.

### Troubleshooting

If your app fails to start, verify that the app starts in your local environment. Refer to the [Troubleshooting Application Deployment and Health](./../../devguide/deploy-apps/troubleshoot-app-health.html) topic to learn more about troubleshooting.
