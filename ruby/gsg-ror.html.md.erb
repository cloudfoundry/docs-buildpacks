title: Getting Started Deploying Ruby on Rails Apps

This guide walks you through deploying a Ruby on Rails app to <%=vars.first_product_name%>.

##<a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

In order to deploy a sample Ruby on Rails app, you must have the following:

- A Cloud Foundry deployment or a Pivotal Web Services account
- The [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](../../cf-cli/install-go-cli.html)
- A Cloud Foundry username and password with **Space Developer** [permissions](../../concepts/roles.html#roles). See your [Org Manager](../../concepts/roles.html#roles) if you require permissions.

##<a id='clone'></a>Step 1: Clone the App ##

Run the following terminal command to create a local copy of the cf-sample-app-rails.
<pre class='terminal'>
$ git clone <span>https</span>://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/cf-sample-app-rails.git
</pre>
The newly created directory contains a `manifest.yml` file, which assists CF with deploying the app. See [Deploying with Application Manifests](../../devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html#minimal-manifest) for more information.

##<a id='login'></a>Step 2: Log in and Target the API Endpoint ##

1. Run the following terminal command to log in and target the API endpoint of your deployment.  <%= vars.api_endpoint_book %>

    <pre class='terminal'>$ cf login -a YOUR-API-ENDPOINT</pre>

1. Use your credentials to log in, and to select a [Space and Org](../../concepts/roles.html).

##<a id='service'></a>Step 3: Create a Service Instance ##

Run the following terminal command to create a PostgreSQL service instance for the sample app.
Our service instance is `rails-postgres`. It uses the `elephantsql` service and the `turtle` plan.
For more information about the `elephantsql` service, see [ElephantSQL](http://www.elephantsql.com/).

  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf create-service elephantsql turtle rails-postgres
  Creating service rails-postgres in org YOUR-ORG / space development as   clouduser<span>@</span>example.com....
  OK</pre>

##<a id='deploy'></a>Step 4: Deploy the App ##

Make sure you are in the `cf-sample-app-rails` directory. Run the following terminal command to deploy the app:

<pre class='terminal'>$ cf push cf-sample-app-rails</pre>

`cf push cf-sample-app-rails` creates a URL route to your application in the form HOST.DOMAIN. In this example, HOST is cf-sample-app-rails. Administrators specify the DOMAIN. For example, for the DOMAIN `<%=vars.app_domain%>`, running `cf push cf-sample-app-rails` creates the URL `cf-sample-app-rails.<%=vars.app_domain%>`.

The example below shows the terminal output when deploying the `cf-sample-app-rails`. `cf push` uses the instructions in the manifest file to create the app, create and bind the route, and upload the app. It then follows the information in the manifest to start one instance of the app with 256M of RAM. After the app starts, the output displays the health and status of the app.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push cf-sample-app-rails
Using manifest file ~/workspace/cf-sample-app-rails/manifest.yml

Creating app cf-sample-app-rails in org my-rog / space dev as clouduser@example.com...

</pre>

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: If you want to view log activity while the app deploys, launch a new terminal window and run <code>cf logs cf-sample-app-rails</code>.

##<a id='bind'></a>Step 5: Bind the Service Instance ##

1. Run the command below to bind the service instance to the sample app. Once bound, environment variables are stored that allow the app to connect to the service after
a `cf push`, `cf restage`, or `cf restart` command.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf bind-service cf-sample-app-rails rails-postgres
  Binding service rails-postgres to app cf-sample-app-rails in org my-org / space dev
  OK
  TIP: Use 'cf restage cf-sample-app-rails' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
  </pre>

1. Run the following command to restage the sample app.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf restage cf-sample-app-rails
  </pre>

1. Run the following command to verify the service instance is bound to the sample app.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf services
  Getting services in org my-org / space dev
  OK
  name             service       plan      bound apps            last operation
  rails-postgres   elephantsql   turtle    cf-sample-app-rails   create succeeded
  </pre>


##<a id='verify'></a>Step 6: Verify the App ##

Verify that the app is running by browsing to the URL generated in the output of the previous step. In this example, navigating to `cf-sample-app-rails.<%=vars.app_domain%>` verifies that the app is running.

You've now pushed an app to <%=vars.product_short%>! For more information about this topic, see the [Pushing an App](../../devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html) topic.

##<a id="next"></a>What to Do Next

You have deployed an app to <%=vars.product_name%>. Consult the sections below for information about what to do next.

### Test a Deployed App

Use the cf <%=vars.dev_console_2%> to review information and administer your app and your <%=vars.product_name%> account. For example, you could edit the `manifest.yml` file to increase the number of app instances from 1 to 3 or redeploy the app with a new app name.

### Manage Your App with the cf CLI

Run `cf help` to view a complete list of commands and run `cf help COMMAND` for detailed information about a specific command. For more information about using the cf CLI, refer to the cf CLI topics, especially the <%=vars.cli_v6%> topic.

### Troubleshooting

If your app fails to start, verify that the app starts in your local environment. Refer to the [Troubleshooting Application Deployment and Health](./../../devguide/deploy-apps/troubleshoot-app-health.html) topic to learn more about troubleshooting.
