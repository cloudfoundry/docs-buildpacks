This page has information specific to deploying Rack, Rails, or Sinatra apps with Cloud Foundry.


## <a id='bundler'></a> App Bundling

You must run Bundler to create a `Gemfile` and a `Gemfile.lock`. These files must be in your app before you push to Cloud Foundry.

To download Bundler, see [Gem Bundler](http://gembundler.com/).


## <a id='config'></a> Rack Config File

For Rack and Sinatra, you must have a `config.ru` file. For example:

~~~
require './hello_world'
run HelloWorld.new
~~~


## <a id='precompile'></a> Asset Precompilation

Cloud Foundry supports the Rails asset pipeline. If you do not precompile assets before deploying your app, Cloud Foundry precompiles them when staging the app. Precompiling before deploying reduces the time it takes to stage an app.

To precompile assets before deployment, run:

```
rake assets:precompile
```

The Rake precompile task reinitializes the Rails app. This could pose a problem if initialization requires service connections or environment checks that are unavailable during staging. To prevent reinitialization during precompilation, add the following line to `application.rb`:

~~~
config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false
~~~

If the `assets:precompile` task fails, Cloud Foundry uses live compilation mode, the alternative to asset precompilation. In this mode, assets are compiled when they are loaded for the first time. You can force live compilation by adding the following line to `application.rb`.

~~~
Rails.application.config.assets.compile = true
~~~


## <a id='rake'></a> Running Rake Tasks

Cloud Foundry does not provide a mechanism for running a Rake task on a deployed app. If you need to run a Rake task that must be performed in the Cloud Foundry environment, rather than locally before deploying or redeploying, you can configure the command that Cloud Foundry uses to start the app to invoke the Rake task.

An app start command is configured in the app manifest file, `manifest.yml`, using the `command` attribute.

For more information about app manifests and supported attributes, see [Deploying with App Manifests](../../devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html).

### <a id='migrate-ruby-db'></a> Example: Invoking a Rake Database Migration Task at App Startup

Below is an example of migrating a database schema using a Rake task. For more information about migrating database schemas, see the [Migrate a Database Schema](../../devguide/services/index.html#migrating) section of the _Services Overview_ topic.

To migrate a database schema using a Rake task:

1. If a Rakefile does not exist, create one and add it to your app directory.

1. In your Rakefile, add a Rake task to limit an idempotent command to the first instance of a deployed app:

    ~~~
    namespace :cf do
      desc "Only run on the first application instance"
      task :on_first_instance do
        instance_index = JSON.parse(ENV["VCAP_APPLICATION"])["instance_index"] rescue nil
        exit(0) unless instance_index == 0
      end
    end
    ~~~

1. Add the task to the `manifest.yml` file, referencing the idempotent command `rake db:migrate` with the `command` attribute:

    ~~~
    ---
    applications:
    - name: my-rails-app
      command: bundle exec rake cf:on_first_instance db:migrate && bundle exec rails s -p $PORT -e $RAILS_ENV
    ~~~

1. Update the app by running:

    ```
    cf push
    ```


## <a id='workers'></a> Rails 3 Worker Tasks

This section describes how to create and deploy an example Rails app that uses a worker library to defer a task that a separate app runs. It also describes how to scale the resources available to the worker app.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Most worker tasks do not serve external requests. Use the <code>--no-route</code> flag with the <code>cf push</code> command, or <code>no-route: true</code> in the app manifest, to suppress route creation.</p>

### <a id='worker-libs'></a> Choose a Worker Task Library

You must choose a worker task library. The table below summarizes the three main libraries available for Ruby/Rails:

| Library | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [Delayed::Job](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job) | A direct extraction from [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/) where the job table is responsible for a multitude of core tasks. |
| [Resque](https://github.com/defunkt/resque) | A Redis-backed library for creating background jobs, placing those jobs on multiple queues, and processing them later. |
| [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) | Uses threads to handle many messages at the same time in the same process. It does not require Rails, but integrates tightly with Rails 3 to simplify background message processing. This library is Redis-backed and semi-compatible with Resque messaging. |

For other alternatives, see [Background Jobs](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/Background_Jobs) on The Ruby Toolbox.

### <a id='example-app'></a> Create an Example App

The example app described in this section uses Sidekiq.

To create an example app:

1. Create a Rails app with an arbitrary model named "Things" by running:

    ```
    rails create rails-sidekiq
    cd rails-sidekiq
    rails g model Thing title:string description:string
    ```

1. Add `sidekiq` and `uuidtools` to the Gemfile:

    ~~~
    source 'https://rubygems.org'

    gem 'rails', '3.2.9'
    gem 'mysql2'

    group :assets do
      gem 'sass-rails',   '~> 3.2.3'
      gem 'coffee-rails', '~> 3.2.1'
      gem 'uglifier', '>= 1.0.3'
    end

    gem 'jquery-rails'
    gem 'sidekiq'
    gem 'uuidtools'
    ~~~

1. Install the bundle by running:

    ```
    bundle install
    ```

1. In `app/workers`, create a worker for Sidekiq to carry out its tasks by running:

    ```
    touch app/workers/thing_worker.rb
    ```
    Create the worker as follows:

    ~~~
    class ThingWorker

      include Sidekiq::Worker

      def perform(count)

        count.times do

          thing_uuid = UUIDTools::UUID.random_create.to_s
          Thing.create :title =>"New Thing (#{thing_uuid})", :description =>
    "Description for thing #{thing_uuid}"
        end

      end

    end
    ~~~
    This worker create `n` number of things, where `n` is the value passed to the worker.

1. Create a controller for "Things" by running:

    ```
    rails g controller Thing
    ```
    Create the controller as follows:

    ~~~
    class ThingController < ApplicationController

      def new
        ThingWorker.perform_async(2)
        redirect_to '/thing'
      end

      def index
        @things = Thing.all
      end

    end
    ~~~

1. Add a view to inspect our collection of "Things" by running:

    ```
    mkdir app/views/things
    touch app/views/things/index.html.erb
    ```
    Create the view as follows:

    <pre class="terminal">
    &lt;%= @things.inspect %&gt;
    </pre>

#### <a id='deploy'></a> Deploy the App

You must deploy your example app twice for it to work, once as a Rails web app and once as a standalone Ruby app. One way to do this is to keep separate Cloud Foundry manifests for each app type.

To create separate manifests for each app type:

1. Create a web manifest and save it as `web-manifest.yml`:

    ~~~
    ---
    applications:
    - name: sidekiq
      memory: 256M
      instances: 1
      host: sidekiq
      domain: ${target-base}
      path: .
      services:
      - sidekiq-mysql:
      - sidekiq-redis:
    ~~~

1. Create a worker manifest and save it as `worker-manifest.yml`:

    ~~~
    ---
    applications:
    - name: sidekiq-worker
      memory: 256M
      instances: 1
      path: .
      command: bundle exec sidekiq
      no-route: true
      services:
      - sidekiq-redis:
      - sidekiq-mysql:
    ~~~

1. Since the URL `sidekiq.cloudfoundry.com` is likely already taken, change it in `web-manifest.yml` first, then push the app with both manifest files by running:

    ```
    cf push -f web-manifest.yml
    cf push -f worker-manifest.yml
    ```
    If the cf CLI asks for a URL for the worker app, select **none**.

### <a id='test'></a> Test the App

To test the app:

1. Visit the new action on the "Thing" controller at the assigned URL. In this example, the URL would be `http://sidekiq.cloudfoundry.com/thing/new`.

This creates a new Sidekiq job which is queued in Redis, then picked up by the worker app. The browser is then redirected to `/thing`, which shows the collection of "Things".

### <a id='scale'></a> Scale Workers

To change the number of Sidekiq workers:

1. Run:

    ```
    cf scale sidekiq-worker -i WORKER-NUMBER
    ```
    Where `WORKER-NUMBER` is the number of Sidekiq workers you want.


## <a id='rails-4'></a> Use rails_serve_static_assets on Rails 4

By default, Rails 4 returns a 404 error if an asset is not handled via an external proxy such as Nginx. The `rails_serve_static_assets` gem enables your Rails server to deliver static assets directly, instead of returning a 404 error.

You can use this capability to populate an edge cache CDN or serve files directly from your web app. The gem enables this behavior by setting the `config.serve_static_assets` option to `true`, so you do not need to configure it manually.


## <a id='custom-libraries'></a> Add Custom Libraries

If your app requires external shared libraries that are not provided by the rootfs or the buildpack, you must place the libraries in an `ld_library_path` directory at the app root.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You must keep these libraries up-to-date. They do not update automatically.</p>

The Ruby buildpack automatically adds the directory `<app-root>/ld_library_path` to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` so that your app can access these libraries at runtime.


## <a id='env-var'></a> Environment Variables

You can access environments variable programmatically. For example, you can obtain `VCAP_SERVICES` by running:

```
ENV['VCAP_SERVICES']
```

Environment variables available to you include both those defined by the system and those defined by the Ruby buildpack, as described in the sections below. For more information about system environment variables, see the [App-Specific System Variables](../../devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#app-system-env) section of the _<%= vars.product_short %> Environment Variables_ topic.

### <a id='BUNDLE-BIN-PATH'></a> BUNDLE_BIN_PATH

This variable specifies the location where Bundler installs binaries.

For example: `BUNDLE_BIN_PATH:/home/vcap/app/vendor/bundle/ruby/1.9.1/gems/bundler-1.3.2/bin/bundle`

### <a id='BUNDLE-GEMFILE'></a> BUNDLE_GEMFILE

This variable specifies the path to the app Gemfile.

For example: `BUNDLE_GEMFILE:/home/vcap/app/Gemfile`

### <a id='BUNDLE-WITHOUT'></a> BUNDLE_WITHOUT

The `BUNDLE_WITHOUT` environment variable instructs Cloud Foundry to skip gem installation in excluded groups.

Use this with Rails apps, where "assets" and "development" gem groups typically contain gems that are not needed when the app runs in production.

For example: `BUNDLE_WITHOUT=assets`

### <a id='DATABASE-URL'></a> DATABASE_URL

Cloud Foundry examines the `database_uri` for bound services to see if they match known database types. If known relational database services are bound to the app, the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set using the first match in the list.

If your app depends on `DATABASE_URL` to be set to the connection string for your service and Cloud Foundry does not set it, use the `cf set-env` command to can set this variable manually.

For example:

```
cf set-env my-app-name DATABASE_URL mysql://example-database-connection-string
```

### <a id='GEM-HOME'></a> GEM_HOME

This variable specifies the location where gems are installed.

For example: `GEM_HOME:/home/vcap/app/vendor/bundle/ruby/1.9.1`

### <a id='GEM-PATH'></a> GEM_PATH

This variable specifies the location where gems can be found.

For example: `GEM_PATH=/home/vcap/app/vendor/bundle/ruby/1.9.1:`

### <a id='RACK-ENV'></a> RACK_ENV

This variable specifies the Rack deployment environment. Valid values are `development`, `deployment`, and `none`. This governs which middleware is loaded to run the app.

For example: `RACK_ENV=development`

### <a id='RAILS-ENV'></a> RAILS_ENV

This variable specifies the Rails deployment environment. Valid values are `development`, `test`, and `production`. This controls which of the environment-specific configuration files governs how the app is run.

For example: `RAILS_ENV=production`

### <a id='RUBYOPT'></a> RUBYOPT

This Ruby environment variable defines command-line options passed to Ruby interpreter.

For example: `RUBYOPT: -I/home/vcap/app/vendor/bundle/ruby/1.9.1/gems/bundler-1.3.2/lib -rbundler/setup`
