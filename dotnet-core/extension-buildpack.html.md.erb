This topic explains how to write extension buildpacks for .NET apps.

## <a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

* Linux or MacOS development machine or virtual machine
* [Golang](https://golang.org/) v1.10 or later programming language
* [direnv](https://direnv.net/) environment variable manager for your shell

## <a id='initialize'></a>Initialize an Extension Buildpack

1. To install the `buildpack-packager` CLI tool, run the commands below. The
[buildpack-packager](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/libbuildpack/packager/buildpack-packager)
provides boilerplate code that you can use to start writing your buildpack.

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ go get github.com/cloudfoundry/libbuildpack/
    $ go install github.com/cloudfoundry/libbuildpack/packager
    </pre>

1. To create your buildpack, run the following command:

    ```
    buildpack-packager init --name MY-BUILPACK-NAME --path=BUILDPACK-DIRECTORY
    ```
	 Where:
    * `MY-BUILDPACK-NAME` is the name of the buildpack you are creating.
    * `BUILDPACK-DIRECTORY` is the directory created by the command. This directory contains the
      boilerplate code.

    For example:
    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ buildpack-packager init --name my-example --path=my-example-buildpack
    </pre>

1. To activate direnv in your buildpack directory, run the following commands:

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ cd my-example-buildpack
    $ direnv allow
    </pre>

## <a id='create'></a>Create an Extension Buildpack to Supply Additional DLLs to a .NET Framework App

Most .NET Framework apps are pushed with the [Hosted Web Core (HWC) buildpack](../hwc/index.html).
The HWC buildpack contains an opinionated list of .NET dependencies and does not contain all the
DLLs that every app could need.

If your app requires dependencies not contained in the HWC buildpack, we recommend that you create
an extension buildpack. This extension buildpack references and supplies these dependencies to the app's container when you push the app.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot add modules or extensions directly to HWC. HWC
contains a number of built-in HWC features, like the URL Rewrite module and HTTP compression.
Extensions should only provide additional functionality to your app. For more information about
existing HWC features, see <a href="../hwc/index.html#features">Features</a> in
<em>HWC Buildpack</em>.</p>

To create an extension buildpack containing additional DLLs, follow the steps below:

1. Create a list of the dependencies that your published app requires.

1. Copy the DLLs for the dependencies into a zip file.

1. Upload the zip file containing your dependencies to a private web server that is accessible by
Cloud Foundry. You can also use an S3 bucket or Azure Storage.

1. On the command line, browse to the directory created by the `buildpack-packager init` command
above.

1. Edit the `manifest.yml` file by adding a `dependency` section that references the DLL zip file
as follows:

    ```
    dependencies:
    - name: my-binary 
      uri: http://s3.amazon.com/my-bucket/DLL-ZIP-FILE 
      version: 0.0.1
      sha256: GENERATED-SHA-256
      cf_stacks: 
      - windows2016 
    ```
    Where:
    * `DLL-ZIP-FILE` is the name of your DLL zip file.
    * `GENERATED-SHA-256` is a SHA generated by running the following command:

        ```
        shasum -a256 DLL-ZIP-FILE
        ```
        Where `DLL-ZIP-FILE` is the name of your DLL zip file.

1. Ensure the `include_files` section of the manifest contains `bin/supply.exe`.

1. Edit the supply script, `my-example-buildpack/src/my-example/supply.go`, to add dependencies to
the container's `PATH` as follows:

    1. Add a `stager.InstallDependency` for the `dependency` and `version` you have in your
    manifest.yml file.

    1. Add a `stager.AddBinDependency` for every DLL file you want your app to be able to access.
    For example:

        ```
        dep := libbuildpack.Dependency{Name: "my-binary", Version: "0.0.1"}
        if err := s.Installer.InstallDependency(dep, s.Stager.DepDir()); err != nil {
          return err
        }
        if err := s.Stager.AddBinDependencyLink(filepath.Join(s.Stager.DepDir(), "MyBinary.dll"), "MyBinary.dll"); err != nil {
          return err
        }
        ```

1. Edit `scripts/build.sh` to cross-compile as follows:

    ```
    GOOS=windows go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o bin/supply.exe mysql/supply/cli
    ```

## <a id='finish'></a>Complete Extension Buildpack

1. To build a cached buildpack artifact, run the following command:

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ buildpack-packager build -cached -stack windows2016
    </pre>
    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If the buildpack code contains a mistake,
    <code>buildpack-packager</code> throws an error. Once all local errors are corrected, you must
    push your app to with the new extension buildpack to determine whether the new buildpack
    functions as intended.</p>

1. Upload the buildpack to a private web server accessible to Cloud Foundry. You can also use an S3
bucket or Azure Storage. You can upload the finished buildpack to the same web server as your
dependencies. 

1. To deploy your app with the extension buildpack, run the following command:

    ```
    cf push my-app -s windows2016 -b BUILDPACK-URL -b hwc_buildpack
    ```
    Where `BUILDPACK-URL` is the URL where you uploaded the buildpack.
    For example:
    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ cf push my-app -s windows2016 -b http<span>:</span>//s3.amazon.com/my-bucket/my-example-buildpack.zip -b hwc_buildpack
    </pre>

If your extension buildpack does not include the correct dependencies, you will receive an error
message.

## <a id='combine'></a>Combine Extension Buildpack with Other Features

If your extension buildpack has executables or scripts that need to be run, you can reference them
either in the start command or in profile scripts.

* For more information about the start command, see
[command](../../devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html#start-commands) in <em>Deploying with Application Manifests</em>.

* For more information about profile scripts, see
[Configure Pre-Runtime Hooks](../../devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html#profile) in <em>Deploy an Application</em>.
