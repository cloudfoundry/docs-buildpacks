This topic describes how to push Cloud Foundry apps using the .NET Core buildpack. You can find supported ASP.NET Core versions in the .NET Core buildpack [release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/dotnet-core-buildpack/releases).

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note</strong>: The .NET Core buildpack only works with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/core">ASP.NET Core</a>.

## <a id='pushing_apps'></a> Push an App ##

Cloud Foundry automatically uses the .NET Core buildpack when:

- The pushed app contains one or more `project.json` files.
- The app is pushed from the output directory of the `dotnet publish` command.

If your Cloud Foundry deployment does not have the .NET Core buildpack installed or the installed version is out of date, push your app with the `-b` option to specify the buildpack:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push MY_APP -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/dotnet-core-buildpack.git
</pre>

If you do not want to use latest stable beta release of the .NET CLI, specify the version in the `global.json` file. 

Specify any non-default package sources in the `NuGet.Config` file.

For a basic example see this [Hello World sample](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/aspnet-core-helloworld).

## <a id='port'></a>Configure the Listen Port ##

The samples provided in the [cli-samples repo](https://github.com/aspnet/cli-samples/) and the templates provided by Visual Studio and Yeoman work with this buildpack, but you must modify the `Main` method to make the app listen on the port specified by the `$PORT` environment variable that Cloud Foundry automatically sets. 

1. Open the file that contains your `Main` method.

1. Add a `using` statement to the top of the file:

    ```c#
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
    ```

1. Add the following lines before the line `var host = new WebHostBuilder()`:

    ```c#
var config = new ConfigurationBuilder()
    .AddCommandLine(args)
    .Build();
    ```

1. Remove the following line from the `Main` method.

    ```c#
.UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
    ```

1. Add this line after `.UseKestrel()`:

    ```c#
.UseConfiguration(config)
    ```

1. Save the file, and then open `project.json`.


1. Add the following dependency:

    ```json
"Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.CommandLine": "1.0.0",
    ```

1. Add the following property to the `buildOptions` section:

    ```json
"copyToOutput": {
    "include": [
    "wwwroot",
    "Areas/**/Views",
    "Views",
    "appsettings.json"
    ]
}
    ```

1. Remove the following line from the `Startup` method:

    ```c#
.SetBasePath(env.ContentRootPath)
    ```

1. If your app requires any other files at runtime, such as JSON configuration files, add them to the `include` section of `copyToOutput`.

1. Save.

With these changes, the `dotnet run` command copies your app `Views` to the build output, where the .NET CLI can find them. Refer to the following example `Main` method:

```c#
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var config = new ConfigurationBuilder()
        .AddCommandLine(args)
        .Build();

    var host = new WebHostBuilder()
        .UseKestrel()
        .UseConfiguration(config)
        .UseStartup<Startup>()
        .Build();
    host.Run();
}
```

## <a id='multiple_projects'></a>Deploy Apps with Multiple Projects ##

To deploy an app that contains multiple projects, specify the project you want the buildpack to run as the main project.  

Create a `.deployment` file in the root folder of the .NET solution file which sets the path to the main project. You can also specify the path to the main project as the project folder or the project file, `.xproj` or `.csproj`.

For example, if a solution contains three projects in the `src` folder, the main project `MyApp.Web` plus `MyApp.DAL` and `MyApp.Services`, format the `.deployment` file as follows:

```text
[config]
project = src/MyApp.Web
```

In this case, the buildpack automatically compiles the `MyApp.DAL` and `MyApp.Services` projects if the `project.json` file of the main project lists them as dependencies, `MyApp.Web`. The buildpack attempts to execute the main project with `dotnet run -p src/MyApp.Web`. You can also specify the path to `MyApp.Web` as `project = src/MyApp.Web/MyApp.Web.xproj`, assuming the project is an xproj project.

## <a id='disconnected_environments'></a>Push an App in a Disconnected Environment ##

For offline use, you can cache the binaries in `manifest.yml` with the buildpack.

You can push apps with their other dependencies following these steps:

1. Publish the app by running `dotnet publish -r ubuntu.14.04-x64`.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For this publish command to work, modify your app code so the .NET CLI publishes it as a self-contained app.
For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/deploying/">.NET Core Application Deployment</a>.</p>

1. Navigate to the `bin/<Debug|Release>/<framework>/<runtime>/publish` directory. Or, if your app uses a `manifest.yml`, specify a path to the publish output folder. This allows you to push your app from any directory.


1. Push your app.
