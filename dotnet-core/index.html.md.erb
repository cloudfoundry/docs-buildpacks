<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to push Cloud Foundry apps using the .NET Core buildpack. You can find supported ASP.NET Core versions 
in the [.NET Core buildpack release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/dotnet-core-buildpack/releases).

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview
Buildpacks provide needed dependencies to <%= vars.product_windows_full %> apps. <%= vars.product_windows %> automatically uses the .NET Core buildpack when one or more of the following conditions are met:

- The pushed app contains one or more `*.csproj` or `*.fsproj` files.
- The app is pushed from the output directory of the `dotnet publish` command.

For information about deploying different types of .NET apps, follow the links in the table below.

## <a id='pushing-apps'></a> Push an App ##

Follow the steps below to push your app.

1. To push you app, run the following command:

    ```
    cf push APP-NAME
    ```
    Where `APP-NAME` is the name you want to give your app.  
<br>
    If your <%= vars.product_windows %> deployment does not have the .NET Core buildpack installed or the installed version is out of date, 
    run the push command with the `-b` option to specify buildpack:

    ```
    cf push APP-NAME -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/dotnet-core-buildpack.git
    ```

    Where `APP-NAME` is the name you want to give your app.  
<br>
    For example:

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ cf push my-app
    Creating app my-app in org sample-org / space sample-space as username@example.com...
    OK
    ...
    requested state: started
    instances: 1/1
    usage: 1GB x 1 instances
    urls: my-app.example.com
    </pre>

1. Find the URL of your app in the push command output. In the example above, `my-app.example.com` is the URL of the app. 
Open a browser and navigate to the URL to see your app running.  

For a basic example app, see [ASP.NET Core getting started app](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/aspnet-core-helloworld) in GitHub.

## <a id='source-based'></a>Source-Based, Non-Published Deployments

When using this workflow, you push the source code for your app to Cloud Foundry by running the `cf push` command.
Note that for a source-based, non-published deployment, you push the source code for your app, not the output directory of the `dotnet publish` command.

The source-based, non-published workflow ensures the buildpack can keep all your dependencies in sync and up to date.
For additional information about using source-based, non-published deployments, see the following sections:

* [Deploy Apps with Multiple Projects](#multiple-projects)
* [Use Non-Default Package Sources](#non-default-package-sources)
* [Disable and Clear Your NuGet Package Cache](#disabling-nuget)

### <a id='multiple-projects'></a>Deploy Apps with Multiple Projects

If you want to deploy an app that contains multiple projects, you must specify your main project for the buildpack to run.  

The buildpack automatically compiles the projects listed as dependencies in the main project's `*.csproj` or `*.fsproj` file.

1. To specify your main project, create a `.deployment` file in your app's root folder
1. Modify the file to set the path to the main project using the following format:

    ```
    text
    [config]
    project = PATH-TO-YOUR-MAIN-PROJECT
    ```

    Where `PATH-TO-YOUR-MAIN-PROJECT` is the location of your main project's `*.csproj` or `*.fsproj` file.  
<br>
    For example: 

    <pre class="terminal">text
    [config]
    project = src/MyApp.Web/MyApp.Web.csproj
    </pre>

    In this example, the `.deployment` file is configured to assign `MyApp.Web` as the main project by pointing to that project's `*.csproj` file.

1. When deployed, the buildpack attempts to execute the main project using the `dotnet run` command, `dotnet run -p PATH-TO-YOUR-MAIN-PROJECT`.  
<br>
    For example: If the last example's app `src` folder contains the `MyApp.Web` folder as well as two other project folders, `MyApp.DAL` and `MyApp.Services`, 
    and the `MyApp.Web.csproj` file lists the additional projects as dependencies, the `MyApp.DAL` and `MyApp.Services` projects will be compiled by the buildpack.

### <a id='non-default-package-sources'></a>Use Non-Default Package Sources

If you want to deploy an app that uses non-default package sources,
you must specify those package sources in the `NuGet.Config` file.
For information about `NuGet.Config`,
see [nuget.config reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuget-config-file)
in the Microsoft documentation.

### <a id='disabling-nuget'></a>Disable and Clear Your NuGet Package Cache

You may need to disable NuGet package caching or clear NuGet packages cached in the staging environment
in one of the following scenarios:

* Your app fails to stage because it runs out of space, exceeding the maximum allowable disk quota.
* You have added pre-release packages to test a new feature and then decided to revert back to the main NuGet feed.
You may need to remove the packages you changed from the cache to avoid conflicts.

Disabling NuGet caching clears any existing NuGet dependencies from the staging cache
and prevents the buildpack from adding NuGet dependencies to the staging cache.

NuGet package caching is disabled by default. If the variable is not explicitly set to true, no change is required.

To disable NuGet package caching, set the `CACHE_NUGET_PACKAGES` environment variable to `false`.

1. Confirm `CACHE_NUGET_PACKAGES` is not set to `true` in your app manifest by locating the `manifest.yml` and confirming `CACHE_NUGET_PACKAGES` is not set to true.
1. If needed, set `CACHE_NUGET_PACKAGES` to `false` in the `manifest.yml` by locating your app manifest, `manifest.yml`, and setting the `CACHE_NUGET_PACKAGES` environment variable to `false`.  
<br>
    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">---
    applications:
    &#8209; name: sample&#8209;aspnetcore&#8209;app
      memory: 512M
      env:
        CACHE&#95;NUGET&#95;PACKAGES: false
    </pre>

1. To configure the setting to false in the environment variables settings run the following on the command line:

    ```
    cf set-env APP-NAME CACHE_NUGET_PACKAGES false
    ```

    Where `APP-NAME` is the name of your app.

For more information, see the [Environment Variables](../../devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html#env-block) section
of the <em>Deploying with Application Manifests</em> topic.

## <a id='framework-dependent'></a>Framework-Dependent Deployments##

For a framework-dependent deployment (FDD), you deploy only your app and third-party dependencies.
Cloud Foundry recommends using this workflow if you deploy an app in an offline setting.
For information about deploying FDDs, see
[Framework-dependent deployments (FDD)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/index#framework-dependent-deployments-fdd)
in the Microsoft documentation.

To deploy an FDD using the buildpack, do the following:

1. Publish the app by running the `dotnet publish` command:

    <pre>dotnet publish [-f YOUR-FRAMEWORK] [-c Release]</pre>

    Where `YOUR-FRAMEWORK` is your target framework.

1. Navigate to the `bin/Debug|Release/YOUR-FRAMEWORK/YOUR-RUNTIME/publish` directory.
Alternatively, if your app uses a `manifest.yml`, specify a path to the output folder of `dotnet publish`.
This allows you to push your app from any directory.

1. Push your app.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Set <code>applyPatches: false</code> in  <code>*.runtimeconfig.json</code> only if you want
to pin your .NET Framework to a specific version. This prevents your app
from receiving updates to the runtime version and assemblies.</p>

## <a id='self-contained'></a>Self-Contained Deployments##

For a self-contained deployment (SCD), you deploy your app, third-party dependencies,
and the version of .NET Core that you used to build your app. For information about SCDs,
see [Self-contained deployments (SCD)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd)
in the Microsoft documentation.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Cloud Foundry does not recommend using the SCD workflow.
Because this workflow results in a pre-published binary,
the buildpack is not able to keep all your dependencies in sync and up to date.</p>

When using the SCD workflow for deploying your app,
you must specify a runtime in the `dotnet publish` command. For example:

<pre class='terminal'>
$ dotnet publish -r ubuntu14.04-x64
</pre>

In addition, you must include the specified runtime in the `RuntimeIdentifiers` section of the project file.

## <a id='dotnet-sdk'></a> Specify .NET Core SDKs

To pin the .NET Core SDK to a specific version or version line, create a `buildpack.yml` file at the app root
and add your SDK version in one of the following formats:

```
dotnet-core:
  sdk: 2.1.201
```

```
dotnet-core:
  sdk: 2.1.x
```

```
dotnet-core:
  sdk: 2.x
```

The buildpack chooses what SDK to install based on the files present at the app root in the following order of precedence:

1. `buildpack.yml`
1. `global.json`
1. `*.fsproj`

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The app respects the SDK version specified in <code>global.json</code> at runtime.
If you provide versions in the <code>global.json</code> and <code>buildpack.yml</code> files,
ensure that you specify the same versions in both files.</p>

## <a id='dotnet-runtime'></a>Specify .NET Runtime Versions

This section explains how to specify a .NET Runtime version for source-based and framework-dependent apps.

### <a id='dotnet-runtime-source-based'></a>Source-Based Apps

For source-based apps, specify a minor version of the .NET Runtime.
Do not specify a patch version because
buildpacks contain only the two most recent patch versions of each minor version.

If you want to lock the .NET Runtime version, add the following to your `.csproj` or `.fsproj` file:

```
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>
  <RuntimeFrameworkVersion>2.1.*</RuntimeFrameworkVersion>
</PropertyGroup>
```

### <a id='dotnet-runtime-fdd'></a>Framework-Dependent Apps

In your `.runtimeconfig.json` app, the latest .NET Runtime patch version is used by default.
If you want to set a specific .NET Runtime version, add the `applyPatches` property and set it to `false` as follows:

```
{
  "runtimeOptions": {
    "tfm": "netcoreapp2.0",
    "framework": {
      "name": "Microsoft.NETCore.App",
      "version": "2.0.0"
    },
    "applyPatches": false
  }
}
```

## <a id='offline'></a> Push an App in a Disconnected Environment

For offline environments, Cloud Foundry recommends using the [Framework-Dependent Deployments](#framework-dependent)
workflow. This workflow enables the deployed app to use the latest runtime provided by the offline buildpack.

## <a id='runtime-store'></a>Maintain ASP.NET Core Assemblies

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This section applies only to source-based and framework-dependent deployments.</p>

For maintaining ASP.NET Core assemblies, update your `.csproj` file with the following:

```
<PropertyGroup>
  <PublishWithAspNetCoreTargetManifest>false</PublishWithAspNetCoreTargetManifest>
</PropertyGroup>
```

This results in a fully vendored app that requires fewer buildpack updates.

Alternatively, to keep your SDK up to date, you can set `buildpack.yml` to the .NET SDK line you want to use:

```
---
dotnet-core:
	sdk: 2.0.x
```

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <code>2.0.x</code> ASP.NET Core assemblies are released
in the <code>2.1.200</code>-<code>2.1.299</code> SDK versions,
and <code>2.1.x</code> assemblies are released in the <code>2.1.300</code> and above SDK versions.</p>

## <a id='port'></a>Configure the Listen Port ##

For your .NET Core app to work on <%= vars.product_windows %>,
you must modify the `Main` method to configure the app to listen on the port specified by the `$PORT` environment variable.
<%= vars.product_windows %> sets this environment variable automatically.

1. Open the file that contains your `Main` method.

1. Add a `using` statement to the top of the file.

    ```c#
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
    ```

1. Add the following lines before the line `var host = new WebHostBuilder()`:

    ```c#
    var config = new ConfigurationBuilder()
        .AddCommandLine(args)
        .Build();
    ```
1. Add the following line after `.UseKestrel()`:

    ```c#
    .UseConfiguration(config)
    ```

    This allows the buildpack to pass the correct port from `$PORT` to the app when running the initial startup command.

1. Add `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.CommandLine` as a dependency in `*.csproj`:

    ```
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.CommandLine">
      <Version>VERSION</Version>
    </PackageReference>
    ```

    In the above example, replace `VERSION` with the version of the package to use.
    To find a list of valid versions, navigate to https://www.nuget.org.

1. If your app requires any other files at runtime, such as JSON configuration files, add them to the `include` section of `copyToOutput`.

1. Save your changes.

With these changes, the `dotnet run` command copies your app `Views` to the build output where the .NET CLI can find them.
Refer to the following example `Main` method:

```c#
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var config = new ConfigurationBuilder()
        .AddCommandLine(args)
        .Build();

    var host = new WebHostBuilder()
        .UseKestrel()
        .UseConfiguration(config)
        .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
        .UseStartup<Startup>()
        .Build();
    host.Run();
}
```

## <a id='custom-libraries'></a>Add Custom Libraries

If your app requires external shared libraries that are not provided by the rootfs or the buildpack, you must place the libraries in an `ld_library_path` directory at the app root.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You must keep these libraries up to date. They do not update automatically.</p>

The .NET Core buildpack automatically adds the directory `<app-root>/ld_library_path` to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` so that your app can access these libraries at runtime.
