The Staticfile buildpack works for apps and content that require no backend code besides an Nginx webserver, which the buildpack provides. Examples include front-end JavaScript apps, static HTML content, and HTML/JavaScript forms. It also supports apps with backends hosted elsewhere.

To find which version of Nginx the current Staticfile buildpack uses, see the [release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/staticfile-buildpack/releases).

## <a id='pushing_apps'></a> Push an App ##

This buildpack will be used if your directory has a `Staticfile` file in the root directory.

For example, in an empty directory:

```bash
echo '<html>hello</html>' > index.html
touch Staticfile
cf push APPNAME -m 64M
```

If your Cloud Foundry deployment does not have the Staticfile Buildpack installed, or the installed version is out of date, you can use the latest version with the command:

```bash
cf push APPNAME -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/staticfile-buildpack.git -m 64M
```

Why `-m 64M`? Your static assets will be served by [Nginx](http://nginx.com/) and it only requires 20M \[[reference](http://wiki.nginx.org/WhyUseIt)]. The `-m 64M` reduces the RAM allocation from the default 1G allocated to Cloud Foundry containers. In the future there may be a way for a buildpack to indicate its default RAM requirements; but not as of writing.

## <a id='configuration'></a> Configuration ##

You can configure how the Staticfile buildpack accesses and serves apps by editing the `Staticfile` or `nginx.conf` files.

### <a id='root_folder'></a> Specify an Alternate Root Folder ###
By default, the buildpack will serve `index.html` and all other assets from the root folder of your project.

In many cases, you may have an alternate folder where your HTML/CSS/JavaScript files are to be served from, such as `dist/` or `public/`.

To configure the buildpack add the following line to your `Staticfile`:

```yaml
root: dist
```

### <a id='authentication'></a> Enable or Disable Basic Authentication ###

Protect your website with a user/password configured via environment variables.

![Basic Authentication](../images/basicauth.png)

Convert the username / password to the required format: http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/

For example, username `bob` and password `bob` becomes `bob:$apr1$DuUQEQp8$ZccZCHQElNSjrg.erwSFC0`.

Create a file in the root of your application `Staticfile.auth`. This becomes the `.htpasswd` file for Nginx to project your site. It can include one or more user/password lines.

```
bob:$apr1$DuUQEQp8$ZccZCHQElNSjrg.erwSFC0
```

Push your application to apply changes to basic auth. Remove the file and push to disable basic auth.

### <a id='directory_index'></a> Directory List Instead of 404 If Missing index.html ###

If your site doesn't have a nice `index.html`, you can configure `Staticfile` to display a Directory Index of other files; rather than show a relatively unhelpful 404 error.

![Directory Index](../images/directory-index.png)

Add a line to your `Staticfile` that begins with `directory:`

```
directory: visible
```

### <a id='server_side_includes'></a> Enable Server Side Includes (SSI) ###

Add the following line to your `Staticfile` to enable support for [SSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes):

```
ssi: enabled
```

### <a id='pushstate'></a> Enable Pushstate Routing ###

With client-side JavaScript apps that serve multiple routes, pushstate routing keeps browser-visible URLs clean. For example, pushstate routing allows a single JavaScript file route to multiple anchor-tagged URLs that look like `/some/path1` instead of `/some#path1`.

To enable support for pushstate routing, add the following line to your `Staticfile`:

```
pushstate: enabled
```

### <a id='gzip'></a> Disable Serving and Decompressing GZip Files ###

The [`gzip_static`](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gzip_static_module.html) and [`gunzip`](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gunzip_module.html) modules are set to `on` by default.
`gzip_static` enables Nginx to serve files stored in compressed `.gz` format, and `gunzip` uncompresses them for clients that do not support compressed content or responses.

To disable these modules, specify the following in your custom `nginx.conf`:

```
gunzip off;
gzip_static off;
```

### <a id='force'></a> Force HTTPS ###

To only allow requests sent via HTTPS, set the `FORCE_HTTPS` environment variable. 
This redirects non-HTTPS requests as HTTPS requests.

The value that `FORCE_HTTPS` is set to does not matter, only that the environment variable is set. 
For example, `FORCE_HTTPS: true` and `FORCE_HTTPS: enabled` both force HTTPS.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you are using a reverse proxy like CloudFlare 
and have rules that redirect HTTP to HTTPS, these can cause redirect loops with 
your app if <code>FORCE_HTTPS</code> is also enabled.
In the example of CloudFlare, when attempting to make an HTTPS request to the app, 
the connection between the user and CloudFlare is HTTPS but the connection between CloudFlare 
and your app is via HTTP, which your app then redirects as HTTPS.</p>

### <a id='custom_nginx_configuration'></a> Custom Nginx Configuration ###

You can customize the Nginx configuration further, by adding `nginx.conf` and/or `mime.types` to your root folder. (Note that if you specified an [alternate root folder](#root_folder), the files will need to be placed there.)

If the buildpack detects either of these files, they will be used in place of the built-in versions.


## <a id='proxy_support'></a> Proxy Support ##

If you need to use a proxy to download dependencies during staging, you can set
the `http_proxy` and/or `https_proxy` environment variables. For more information, see
the [Proxy Usage Docs](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/proxy-usage.html).

## <a id='bosh_trusted_cert'></a>BOSH Configured Custom Trusted Certificate Support ##

The staticfile-buildpack, based on Nginx, does not make outgoing requests and does not benefit from [BOSH configured custom trusted certificates](http://bosh.io/docs/trusted-certs.html).
