This topic describes how to configure and use the Staticfile buildpack.


## <a id='definitions'></a> Definitions

**Staticfile app**: An app or content that requires no backend code other than the NGINX webserver, which the buildpack provides. Examples of staticfile apps are front-end JavaScript apps, static HTML content, and HTML/JavaScript forms.

**Staticfile buildpack**: The buildpack that provides runtime support for staticfile apps and apps with back ends hosted elsewhere. To find which version of NGINX the current Staticfile buildpack uses, see the [Staticfile buildpack release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/staticfile-buildpack/releases).


## <a id='staticfile'></a> Staticfile Detection

If you create a file named `Staticfile` and locate it in the build directory of your app, Cloud Foundry automatically uses the Staticfile buildpack when you push your app.

The `Staticfile` file can be an empty file, or it can contain configuration settings for your app. For more information, see [Configuring the Buildpack](#configure) and [Pushing an App](#push_app).

## <a id='memory'></a> Memory Usage

NGINX requires 20&nbsp;MB of RAM to serve static assets. When using the Staticfile buildpack, <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends pushing apps with the `-m 64M` option to reduce RAM allocation from the default 1&nbsp;GB allocated to containers by default.


## <a id='configure'></a>Configure the Buildpack

This section describes configuration options available for the Staticfile buildpack. If you need to make configuration changes to NGINX that are not listed in the table below, use the NGINX Buildpack instead of the Staticfile buildpack. For more information, see [NGINX Buildpack](../nginx/index.html).

### <a id='staticfile'></a> Staticfile File Configuration

To configure these options, add the configuration property as a new line in your `Staticfile` file as described in the following table.

<table border='1' class='nice'>
  <tr>
    <th width="35%">Staticfile Configuration Property</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td id="root">
      <code>root: YOUR-DIRECTORY-NAME</code><br><br>
      Example:<br>
      <code>root: public</code>
    </td>
    <td><strong>Alternative root</strong>: Specifies a root directory other than the default. Use this option to serve <code>index.html</code> and other assets, such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files, from a location other than the root directory.<br><br>
      For example, you can specify an alternate folder such as <code>dist</code> or
      <code>public</code>.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td id="dir-list">
      <code>directory: visible</code>

    <td><strong>Directory list</strong>: Displays an HTML page that shows a directory index for your site. A sample of a directory list is shown below.<br>
      <img src="../images/directory-index.png" alt="directory index" style="margin: 20px"><br>
      If your site is missing an <code>index.html</code> file, your app displays a directory list instead of the standard 404 error page.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td id="ssi">
      <code>ssi: enabled</code>
    </td>
    <td><strong>SSI</strong>: Enables Server Side Includes (SSI), which allow you to embed the contents of one or more files into a web page on a web server. For general information about SSI, see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes">Server Side Includes</a> entry on Wikipedia.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td id="pushstate">
      <code>pushstate: enabled</code>
    </td>
    <td><strong>Pushstate routing</strong>: Keeps browser-visible URLs clean for client-side JavaScript apps that serve multiple routes. For example, pushstate routing allows a single JavaScript file to route to multiple anchor-tagged URLs that look like <code>/some/path1</code> instead of <code>/some#path1</code>.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td id="gzip">
      <code>gzip: off</code>
    </td>
    <td><strong>GZip file serving and compression</strong>: Disables <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gzip_static_module.html">gzip_static</a> and <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gunzip_module.html">gunzip</a> modules, which are enabled by default. These modules allow NGINX to serve files stored in compressed GZ format and to uncompress them for clients that do not support compressed content or responses.<br><br>
      You may want to disable compression under particular circumstances such as serving content to very old browser clients.

    <td><strong>Force HTTPS</strong>: Forces all requests to be sent through HTTPS. This redirects non-HTTPS requests as HTTPS requests.
      <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Do not enable <code>FORCE_HTTPS</code> if you have a proxy server or load balancer loops, for example, if you use <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170416">Flexible SSL</a> with CloudFlare.</p>

### <a id='staticfile'></a>Other Configuration

Follow the instructions below to make other configuration changes.

<hr>

#### <a name="basic-authentication"></a> Basic Authentication

Allows you to enable basic authentication for your app or website. A sample basic authentication dialog box is shown below:

<img src="../images/basicauth.png">

You can create a hashed username and password pair for each user by using a site like <a href="http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/">Htpasswd Generator</a>.

**Configuration**

Add a new <code>Staticfile.auth</code> file to the root or alternative root directory. In the new file, add one or more username and password entries using the following format: <code>USERNAME:HASHED_PASSWORD</code>

Example:

```
pat:$example1$DuUQEQp8$ZccZCHQElNSjrgerwSFC0
stevie:$example1$22derfaecZSJJRw4rKE$KKEWKSK
```
<hr>

#### <a name="custom-location"></a> Custom Location

Allows you to specify custom location definitions with additional directives. For information about NGINX directives, see [Creating NGINX Plus and NGINX Configuration Files](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/basic-functionality/managing-configuration-files) and [Alphabetical index of directives](https://nginx.org/en/docs/dirindex.html) in the _NGINX documentation_.

**Configuration**

To customize the `location` block of the NGINX configuration file:

1. Set an alternative `root` directory. The `location_include` property only works in conjunction with an alternative `root`.

1. Create a file with location-scoped NGINX directives. See the following example, which causes visitors of your site to receive the `X-MySiteName` HTTP header:
    * **File**: `nginx/conf/includes/custom_header.conf`
    * **Content**: `add_header X-MySiteName BestSiteEver;`

1. Set the `location_include` variable in your **Staticfile** to the path of the file from the previous step. This path is relative to `nginx/conf`.

	 Example:

	 ```
    ...
    root: public
    location_include: includes/*.conf
    ...
    ```

<hr>

#### <a name="basic-authentication"></a> Additional MIME Type Support

Allows you to configure additional MIME types on your NGINX server.

**Configuration**

To add MIME types, add a `mime.types` file to your root folder, or to the alternate root folder if you specified one.

For more information about the `mime.types` file, see [mime.types](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/full/#mime-types") in the _NGINX documentation_.

Example MIME types file:

```
types {
    text/html     html htm shtml;
    text/css      css;
    text/xml      xml rss;
    image/gif     gif;
    ...
    }
```

<hr>


## <a id='push_app'></a> Push an App

To push your app, you can use either the system Staticfile buildpack or specify a Staticfile buildpack.

### Option 1: Use the System Staticfile Buildpack

To use the Staticfile buildpack installed in your deployment, run the command below in the root directory of the app.
The root directory of the app must contain a file named `Staticfile`.

```
cf push APP-NAME
```

Where `APP-NAME` is the name you want to give your app.

### Option 2: Specify a Staticfile Buildpack

To explicitly specify a Staticfile buildpack, run the command below in the root directory of the app. You may want to specify a buildpack if your deployment does not have the Staticfile buildpack installed or the installed version is outdated.

```
cf push APP-NAME -b BUILDPACK-NAME-OR-PATH
```

Where:

* `APP-NAME` is the name you want to give your app.
* `BUILDPACK-NAME-OR-PATH` is either the name of a buildpack that is installed in your deployment or the path to a buildpack. You can find the Cloud Foundry Staticfile buildpack in the [Staticfile repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/staticfile-buildpack.git) on GitHub.

### Verifying the Push

After you push the app, follow the steps below to verify that the push was successful:

1. Find the URL of your app in the output of the `cf push` command. For example, the URL in the terminal output above is `my-app.example.com`.

1. In a browser, navigate to the URL to view your app.
