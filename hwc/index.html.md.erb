This topic describes how to configure your .NET Framework apps for use with the HWC buildpack and how to push your .NET Framework apps to <%= vars.windows_runtime_full %>.

## <a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

Using the HWC buildpack requires deploying Windows cells with <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %>.

The HWC buildpack supports the following common app types by default:

  * ASP.NET MVC
  * ASP.NET Web Forms
  * ASP.NET WebAPI Apps
  * Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)

For information about deploying different types of .NET apps, follow the links in the table below.

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

The HWC buildpack provides a runtime server that uses the Hosted Web Core API for running .NET Framework applications in Windows Server containers. For more information, see [Hosted Web Core API Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms693832(v=vs.90).aspx) in the Microsoft documentation.

The HWC buildpack provides access to .NET Framework 4.5.1 and later, made available by the Windows root file system (rootfs).

Before you push your first app using the HWC buildpack, see the [Getting Started](https://dotnet-cookbook.cfapps.io/intro/getting_started/) guide in the <em>.NET Cookbook</em>.

## <a id='hwc'></a> Step 1. Configure HWC

HWC relies on `Web.config` and `applicationHost.config` configuration files for configuring the .NET applications.

Most `Web.config` files work out of the box with <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %>, with the following constraints:

- Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA) is not yet supported on <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %>.
- SQL server connection strings must use fully qualified domain names.
- Place connection string values in environment variables or [user-provided service instances](../../devguide/services/user-provided.html).

Additionally, [Shadow Copy Setting](#shadow-copy), and [Dynamic and Static HTTP Compression](#http-compression) `Web.config` settings can be customized as needed.

The HWC buildpack includes a default configuration for the `applicationHost.config`, similar to IIS.

## <a id="error-handling"></a> Step 2. Add a Global Error Handler

Before you push your app for the first time, add a global error handler to receive log information from your app if it crashes on startup.

To configure a global error handler that logs to `stdout`, see [Application Error Handling](https://dotnet-cookbook.cfapps.io/intro/getting_started/#application-error-handling) in the <em>.NET Cookbook</em>.

## <a id='push-your-app'></a> Step 3. Push an App

Follow the steps below to push your application.

1. Build your HWC app in Visual Studio.

1. On the command line, navigate to the directory containing the app files.

1. To push your HWC app, run the following `cf push` command:

    ```shell
    cf push APP-NAME -s windows -b hwc_buildpack
    ```

    Where `APP-NAME` is the name you want to give your app.
<br>
    For example:

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ cf push my-app -s windows -b hwc_buildpack
    Creating app my-app in org sample-org / space sample-space as username@example.com...
    OK
    ...
    requested state: started
    instances: 1/1
    usage: 1&nbsp;GB x 1 instances
    urls: my-app.example.com
    </pre>

1. Confirm your application is running by finding your app's URL in the push command output and navigating to it. In the example above, `my-app.example.com` is the URL of your app.

## <a id='features'></a> Features

The following features can be used with HWC buildpack:
<ul>
  <li>[Context Path Routing](#context-path)</li>
  <li>[Shadow Copy Setting](#shadow-copy)</li>
  <li>[Dynamic and Static HTTP Compression](#http-compression)</li>
  <li>[URL Rewrite](#url-rewrite)</li>
  <li>[Profile Scripts](#profile-scripts)</li>
</ul>

### <a id='context-path'></a> Context Path Routing

Context path routing enables multiple apps to share the same route hostname,
such as `app1.example.com/app2`. The context path routing feature is analogous to IIS virtual directories.

Making an application accessible under another app's URL requires pushing both apps and applying a map-route between them.
To define a context path route, such as `app1.example.com/app2`, run the following commands:

1. To push the primary app, run the following command:

    ```shell
    cf push TOP-LEVEL-APP-NAME -s windows -b hwc_buildpack
    ```

    Where:
      * `TOP-LEVEL-APP-NAME` is your top-level app's name.

1. To push the secondary app and disable the app's starting and default routing, run the following command:

    ```shell
    cf push LOWER-LEVEL-APP-NAME --no-start --no-route -s windows -b hwc_buildpack
    ```

    Where:
      * `LOWER-LEVEL-APP-NAME` is your lower-level app's name.

1. To map routes between the primary and secondary apps, run the following command:

    ```shell
    cf map-route LOWER-LEVEL-APP-NAME APP-DOMAIN --hostname TOP-LEVEL-APP-NAME --path LOWER-LEVEL-APP-NAME
    ```

    Where:
      * `TOP-LEVEL-APP-NAME` is your top-level app's name.
      * `LOWER-LEVEL-APP-NAME` is your lower-level app's name.
      * `APP-DOMAIN` is your site's public domain name.

1. To start the secondary app, run the following command:

    ```shell
    cf start LOWER-LEVEL-APP-NAME
    ```

    Where: `LOWER-LEVEL-APP-NAME` is your lower-level app's name.

For example, the following commands define context path routing for two HWC apps, `app1` and `app2`, where `app2` is made accessible under `app1` as `app1.example.com/app2`:

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf push app1 -s windows -b hwc_buildpack
$ cf push app2 --no-start --no-route -s windows -b hwc_buildpack
$ cf map-route app2 example.com --hostname app1 --path app2
$ cf start app2
</pre>
<br>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: HWC-hosted apps use the <code>VCAP_APPLICATION</code> environment variable
to read out the bound app URIs. Any context path that exists underneath the root in the
app's bound route corresponds to the <code>applicationHost.config</code>.</p>

### <a id='shadow-copy'></a> Shadow Copy Setting
[Shadow Copy](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228159(v=vs.100).aspx)
is a hosting option that copies assemblies for an app in the `bin` directory
to the app's temporary files directory. This feature is turned off and
unnecessary for apps running under Cloud Foundry. An app can override this
setting in its `Web.config` file.

### <a id='http-compression'></a>Dynamic and Static HTTP Compression

The HWC buildpack enables dynamic and static HTTP compression by default.
You can disable HTTP compression in your app's `Web.config` file.

Dynamic HTTP compression is hardcoded at level 4.
Static HTTP compression is hardcoded at level 9.

### <a id='url-rewrite'></a>URL Rewrite

The HWC buildpack supports the URL Rewrite module.
It is preinstalled in the Windows file system.

### <a id='profile-scripts'></a>Profile Scripts

The HWC buildpack allows developers to provide `.profile.bat` scripts with their applications.
You can use a `.profile.bat` script to perform app-specific initialization tasks, such as setting custom environment variables.

For information about configuring `.profile.bat` scripts, see the [Configure Pre-Runtime Hooks](../../devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html#profile) section of <em>Pushing an App</em>.
