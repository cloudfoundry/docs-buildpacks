Buildpacks enable you to package frameworks and/or runtime support for your application.
Cloud Foundry provides system buildpacks out-of-the-box and provides an interface for customizing existing buildpacks and developing new ones.

##<a id="create-buildpacks"></a>Customizing and Creating Buildpacks

If your application uses a language or framework that the Cloud Foundry system buildpacks do not support, do one of the following:

* Use a [Cloud Foundry Community Buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/cf-docs-contrib/wiki/Buildpacks).
* Use a [Heroku Third-Party Buildpack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/third-party-buildpacks).
* Customize an existing buildpack or create your own [custom buildpack](./custom.html). 
A common development practice for custom buildpacks is to fork existing buildpacks and sync subsequent patches from upstream. 
For information about customizing an existing buildpack or creating your own, see the following:

    + <a href="./depend-pkg-offline.html" class="subnav">Packaging Dependencies for Offline Buildpacks</a>

##<a id='maintain-buildpacks'></a>Maintaining Buildpacks

After you have modified an existing buildpack or created your own, it is necessary to maintain it.
Refer to the following when maintaining your own buildpacks:

* <a href="./merging_upstream.html" class="subnav">Merging from Upstream Buildpacks</a>
* <a href="./upgrading_dependency_versions.html" class="subnav">Upgrading Dependency Versions</a>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To configure a production server for your web app, see the <a href="./prod-server.html">Configuring a Production Server</a> topic.</p>

##<a id="using-ci"></a>Using CI for Buildpacks

For information about updating and releasing a new version of a Cloud Foundry buildpack through the Cloud Foundry Buildpacks Team Concourse pipeline, see <a href="./buildpack-ci-index.html" class="subnav">Using CI for Buildpacks</a>. You can use this as a model when working with Concourse to build and release new versions of your own buildpacks.
