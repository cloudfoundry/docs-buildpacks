This buildpack will be automatically used if there is a `package.json` file in the root directory of your project.

If your Cloud Foundry deployment does not have the Node.js Buildpack installed, or the installed version is out of date, you can use the latest version with the command:
```bash
cf push my_app -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/buildpack-nodejs.git
```

For more detailed information on deploying Node.js applications see the following topics:

* <a href="./node-environment.html" class="subnav">Environment Variables Defined by the Node Buildpack</a>
* <a href="./node-service-bindings.html" class="subnav">Configure Service Connections for Node</a>

You can find the source for the buildpack on GitHub:

## <a id='supported_versions'></a>Supported Versions ##

Supported Node versions can be found [in the release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack/releases).

## <a id='runtime'></a>Specifying a Node.js Version##

Set engines.node in package.json to the semver range
(or specific version) of node you'd like to use. For example:

```
"engines": {
  "node": "4.4.x"
}
```

or

```
"engines": {
  "node": "4.4.3"
}
```

If you try to use a version that is not currently supported, staging your app will fail and you will see the following error message:

```
       Could not get translated url, exited with: DEPENDENCY_MISSING_IN_MANIFEST: ...
 !
 !     exit
 !
Staging failed: Buildpack compilation step failed
```

## <a id='vendoring'></a>Vendoring app dependencies ##

As stated in the [Disconnected Environments documentation](https://github.com/cf-buildpacks/buildpack-packager/blob/master/doc/disconnected_environments.md), your application must 'vendor' its dependencies.

For the Node.js buildpack, use ```npm```:

```shell
cd <your app dir>
npm install # vendors into /node_modules
```

```cf push``` uploads your vendored dependencies.

## <a id='openssl'></a>OpenSSL support ##

Since November 2015, the [nodejs-buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack)
has been packaging binaries of Node.js with OpenSSL that are statically linked. With
[community approval](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack/issues/32), it was
decided to support Node.js 4.x and greater, which relied on the Node.js release cycle
to provide OpenSSL updates.

The buildpack's team [binary-builder](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/binary-builder) was
updated to [enable the static openssl compilation](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/binary-builder/commit/834759affa4d7e42294a54b49bac6f1cf81b798a).
All versions of Node.js compiled since have been statically linked with OpenSSL, which
include versions of Node.js greater than and equal to *0.12.10* and *0.10.42*.

## <a id='proxy_support'></a> Proxy Support ##

If you need to use a proxy to download dependencies during staging, you can set
the `http_proxy` and/or `https_proxy` environment variables. For more information, see
the [Proxy Usage Docs](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/proxy-usage.html).

## <a id='BOSH Configured Custom Trusted Certificate Support'></a>BOSH Configured Custom Trusted Certificate Support ##

Nodejs hardcodes root CA certs in its source code. To use [BOSH configured custom trusted certificates](http://bosh.io/docs/trusted-certs.html) a developer must create a connection object and dynamically load in additional custom certs. See the "certfile" section of [this document](https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_ssl) for more details.
