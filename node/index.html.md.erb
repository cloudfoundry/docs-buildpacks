## <a id='pushing_apps'></a>Push Node.js Apps ##

Cloud Foundry automatically uses the Node.js buildpack if it detects a `package.json` file in the root directory of your project.

If your Cloud Foundry deployment does not have the Node.js buildpack installed or the installed version is out of date, you can use the latest version by specifying it with the `-b` option when pushing your application. For example:
```bash
cf push my_app -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/buildpack-nodejs.git
```

For more detailed information about deploying Node.js apps, see the following topics:

* <a href="./node-tips.html" class="subnav">Tips for Node.js Developers</a>
* <a href="./node-environment.html" class="subnav">Environment Variables Defined by the Node Buildpack</a>
* <a href="./node-service-bindings.html" class="subnav">Configuring Service Connections for Node</a>

You can find the source for the buildpack on GitHub:
[https://github.com/cloudfoundry/heroku-buildpack-nodejs](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/heroku-buildpack-nodejs)

## <a id='supported_versions'></a>Supported Versions ##

Supported Node versions can be found [in the release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack/releases).

## <a id='runtime'></a>Specify a Node.js Version##

Set `engines.node` in `package.json` to the semver range or the specific version of node you are using:

```
"engines": {
  "node": "6.9.x"
}
```

or

```
"engines": {
  "node": "6.9.0"
}
```

If you try to use a version that is not currently supported, staging your app fails with the following error message:

<pre class='terminal'>
$   Could not get translated url, exited with: DEPENDENCY_MISSING_IN_MANIFEST:...
$   !
$   !     exit
$   !
$   Staging failed: Buildpack compilation step failed
</pre>

## <a id='npm_version'></a>Specify an npm Version##

Set `engines.npm` in `package.json` to the semver range or specific version of npm you are using:

```
"engines": {
  "node": "6.9.x",
  "npm": "2.15.x"
}
```

or

```
"engines": {
  "node": "6.9.0",
  "npm": "2.15.1"
}
```

If you do not specify an npm version, your app uses the [default npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) packaged with your app's Node.js version.

If your environment cannot connect to the Internet and you specified a non-supported version of npm, the buildpack fails to download npm and you see the following error message:

<pre class='terminal'>
$   We're unable to download the version of npm you've provided (...).
$   Please remove the npm version specification in package.json (...)
$   Staging failed: Buildpack compilation step failed
</pre>

## <a id='vendoring'></a>Vendor App Dependencies ##

As stated in the [Disconnected Environments documentation](https://github.com/cf-buildpacks/buildpack-packager/blob/master/doc/disconnected_environments.md), your app must 'vendor' its dependencies.

For the Node.js buildpack, use ```npm```:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cd YOUR-APP-DIR
$ npm install # vendors into /node_modules
</pre>

```cf push``` uploads your vendored dependencies.

## <a id='openssl'></a>OpenSSL Support ##

The [nodejs-buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack)
packages binaries of Node.js with OpenSSL that are statically linked. The Node.js buildpack supports Node.js 4.x and greater, which relies on the Node.js release cycle to provide OpenSSL updates. The [binary-builder](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/binary-builder) enables [ static OpenSSL compilation](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/binary-builder/commit/834759affa4d7e42294a54b49bac6f1cf81b798a).

## <a id='proxy_support'></a> Proxy Support ##

If you need to use a proxy to download dependencies during staging, you can set
the `http_proxy` and/or `https_proxy` environment variables. For more information, see the [Proxy Usage Docs](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/proxy-usage.html).

## <a id='bosh_trusted_cert'></a>BOSH Configured Custom Trusted Certificate Support ##

Nodejs hardcodes root CA certs in its source code. To use [BOSH configured custom trusted certificates](http://bosh.io/docs/trusted-certs.html), a developer must pass the specified CAs to the [tls.connect](https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_port_host_options_callback) function as extra arguments.
