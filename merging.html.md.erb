# Merging from an upstream buildpack

## Introduction

The buildpacks team endeavours to provide current and dependable buildpacks. We mitigate risks by depending on 
community-tested upstream buildpacks for patches. Doing so allows us to focus on offline capabilities. For example, the
[Cloud Foundry Ruby buildpack](http://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-buildpack-ruby) is a fork of the 
[Heroku Ruby buildpack](http://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby). Changes made to Heroku's buildpack are pulled down into ours.

## Strategy

To merge upstream buildpacks, please ensure you do not use 'git rebase' as you might when doing feature branches. This
approach is not sustainable, as you will need to confront the same merge conflicts over and over again.

Use the approach [outlined on github](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork).
