## <a id='supported_versions'></a>Supported Versions ##

Supported Go versions can be found [in the release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-buildpack/releases).

## <a id='pushing_apps'></a> Push an App ##

The Go buildpack will be automatically detected if:

- Your app has been packaged with [godep](https://github.com/tools/godep) using `godep save`
- Your app has a `vendor/` directory and has any files ending with `.go`.
- Your app has a `GOPACKAGENAME` environment variable specified and has any files ending with `.go`.
- Your app has a `glide.yaml` file and is using [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) <span style="font-size:1rem">(starting in buildpack version <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/python-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.7.9">1.7.9</a>)</span>.

If your Cloud Foundry deployment does not have the Go Buildpack installed, or the installed version is out of date, you can use the latest version with the command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my_app -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-buildpack.git
</pre>

When specifying versions, specify only major/minor versions, eg. Go 1.6, rather than Go 1.6.0. This will ensure you receive the most recent patches.

### <a id='start_command'></a>Start Command ###

When pushing Go goapps, you can specify a start command for the app. The start command can be placed in the file `Procfile` in your app's root directory. For example, if the binary generated by your go project is `my-go-server`, your `Procfile` could be:

```
web: my-go-server
```

For more information about Procfiles, see the [Configuring a Production Server](../prod-server.html) topic.

You can also specify your app's start command in the `manifest.yml` file in the root directory, for example:

```yaml
---
applications:
  - name: my-app-name
    command: my-go-server
```

If you do not specify a start command via a `Procfile`, in the manifest, or via the `-c` flag for `cf push`, the generated binary will be used as the start command. (ex. `my-go-server`)

### <a id='with_godep'></a>Push an App with godep ###
If you are using [godep](https://github.com/tools/godep) to package your dependencies, make sure that you have created a valid `Godeps/Godeps.json` file in the root directory of your app by running `godep save`.

When using godep, you can fix your Go version in  `GoVersion` key of the `Godeps/Godeps.json` file.

#### <a id='godeps_1.5'></a>Go 1.5 ####
* [Sample Go 1.5 app](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-buildpack/tree/master/cf_spec/fixtures/go_app/src/go_app)

An example `Godeps/Godeps.json`:

```json
{
    "ImportPath": "go_app",
    "GoVersion": "go1.5",
    "Deps": []
}
```

An example `manifest.yml`:

```yaml
---
applications:
  - name: my-app-name
```

#### <a id='godeps_1.6'></a>Go 1.6 ####
* [Sample Go 1.6 app](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-buildpack/tree/master/cf_spec/fixtures/go_16_app/src/go_app)

An example `Godeps/Godeps.json`:

```json
{
    "ImportPath": "go_app",
    "GoVersion": "go1.6",
    "Deps": []
}
```

### <a id='with_glide'></a>Push an App with Glide ###
If you are using [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) to specify and/or package your dependencies, make sure that you have created a valid `glide.yaml` file in the root directory of your app by running `glide init`.

To vendor your dependencies before pushing, run `glide install`. This will generate a `vendor` directory and a `glide.lock` file specifying the latest compatible versions of your dependencies. A `glide.lock` is not required when deploying a non-vendored app. A `glide.lock` is required when pushing a vendored app.

####<a id='glide_app'></a>Glide####
* [sample Go app with Glide](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-buildpack/tree/master/cf_spec/fixtures/go_app_with_glide/src/go_app_with_glide)

An example `glide.yaml`:

```yaml
package: go_app_with_glide
import:
- package: github.com/ZiCog/shiny-thing
  subpackages:
  - foo
```

### <a id='pushing_Apps_with_native_Go_vendoring'></a>Push an App with Native Go Vendoring ###
If you are using the native Go vendoring system, which packages all local dependencies in the `vendor/` directory, you must specify your app's package name in the `GOPACKAGENAME` environment variable. An example `manifest.yml`:

```yaml
---
applications:
  - name: my-app-name
    command: go-online
    env:
      GOPACKAGENAME: go-online
```

#### <a id='go 1.5'></a>Go 1.5 ####
**NOTE**: For Go 1.5, since native vendoring is turned off by default, you must set the environment variable `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT` to 1 in your `manifest.yml` to use this feature.

If you are using the `vendor/` directory for dependencies, you can set the Go version with the `GOVERSION` environment variable.

An example `manifest.yml`:

```yaml
---
applications:
  - name: my-app-name
    env:
      GOVERSION: go1.5
      GOPACKAGENAME: app-package-name
      GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT: 1
```

#### <a id='go_1.6'></a>Go 1.6 ####
* [Sample Go 1.6 app with native vendoring](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-buildpack/tree/develop/cf_spec/fixtures/go_with_native_vendoring/src/go_app).

Go 1.6 has vendoring turned on by default. You can turn it off by setting `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=0`.

An example `manifest.yml`:

```yaml
---
applications:
 - name: my-app-name
   command: example-project
   env:
     GOVERSION: go1.6
     GOPACKAGENAME: github.com/example-org/example-project
```

#### <a id='godeps_1.7'></a>Go 1.7+ ####

* [Sample Go 1.7 app with native vendoring](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-buildpack/tree/master/cf_spec/fixtures/go_app_gopath_in_container/src/go_app).

Go 1.7 always has vendoring turned on, and you cannot turn it off with an environment variable.

An example `manifest.yml`:

```yaml
---
applications:
 - name: my-app-name
   command: example-project
   env:
     GOVERSION: go1.7
     GOPACKAGENAME: app-package-name
```

## <a id='passing_symbol_linker'></a>Pass a Symbol and String to the Linker ##

This buildpack supports the go [linker's](https://golang.org/cmd/link/) ability (`-X symbol
value`) to set the value of a string at link time. This can be done by setting
`GO_LINKER_SYMBOL` and `GO_LINKER_VALUE` in the application's config before
pushing code.

This can be used to embed the commit sha, or other build specific data directly
into the compiled executable.

For an example usage, see the relevant [fixture app](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-buildpack/tree/develop/cf_spec/fixtures/go1.6_app_using_ldflags/src/go_app).

## <a id='c_dependencies'></a>C Dependencies ##

This buildpack supports building with C dependencies via
[cgo](https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/). You can set config vars to specify CGO flags
to, e.g., specify paths for vendored dependencies. E.g., to build
[gopgsqldriver](https://github.com/jbarham/gopgsqldriver), add the config var
`CGO_CFLAGS` with the value `-I/app/code/vendor/include/postgresql` and include
the relevant Postgres header files in `vendor/include/postgresql/` in your app.

## <a id='proxy_support'></a> Proxy Support ##

If you need to use a proxy to download dependencies during staging, you can set
the `http_proxy` and/or `https_proxy` environment variables. For more information, see
the [Proxy Usage Docs](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/proxy-usage.html).

## <a id='bosh_trusted_cert'></a>BOSH Configured Custom Trusted Certificate Support ##

Go uses certificates stored in `/etc/ssl/certs` and supports [BOSH configured custom trusted certificates](http://bosh.io/docs/trusted-certs.html) out of the box.
