## <a id='supported_versions'></a>Supported Versions ##

Supported Go versions can be found [in the release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-buildpack/releases).

## <a id='pushing_apps'></a> Push an App ##

The Go buildpack will be automatically detected in the following circumstances:

- Your app has been packaged with [godep](https://github.com/tools/godep) using `godep save`.
- Your app has a `vendor/` directory and has any files ending with `.go`.
- Your app has a `GOPACKAGENAME` environment variable specified and has any files ending with `.go`.
- Your app has a `glide.yml` file and is using [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide), starting in buildpack version <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/python-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.7.9">1.7.9</a>.

If your Cloud Foundry deployment does not have the Go Buildpack installed, or the installed version is out of date, you can use the latest version with the command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my_app -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-buildpack.git
</pre>

When specifying versions, specify only major/minor versions, such as Go 1.6, rather than Go 1.6.0. This ensures you receive the most recent patches.

### <a id='start_command'></a>Start Command ###

When pushing Go apps, you can specify a start command for the app. You can place the start command in the `Procfile` file in root directory of your app. For example, if the binary generated by your Go project is `my-go-server`, your `Procfile` could contain the following:

```
web: my-go-server
```

For more information about Procfiles, see the [Configuring a Production Server](../prod-server.html) topic.

You can also specify the start command for your app in the `manifest.yml` file in the root directory. For example, your `manifest.yml` could contain the following:

```yaml
---
applications:
  - name: my-app-name
    command: my-go-server
```

If you do not specify a start command in a `Procfile`, in the manifest, or with the `-c` flag for `cf push`, the generated binary will be used as the start command. Example: `my-go-server`

### <a id='with_godep'></a>Push an App with godep ###
If you are using [godep](https://github.com/tools/godep) to package your dependencies, make sure that you have created a valid `Godeps/Godeps.json` file in the root directory of your app by running `godep save`.

When using godep, you can fix your Go version in  `GoVersion` key of the `Godeps/Godeps.json` file.

#### <a id='godeps_1.5'></a>Go 1.5 ####
* [Sample Go 1.5 app](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-buildpack/tree/master/cf_spec/fixtures/go_app/src/go_app)

An example `Godeps/Godeps.json`:

```json
{
    "ImportPath": "go_app",
    "GoVersion": "go1.5",
    "Deps": []
}
```

An example `manifest.yml`:

```yaml
---
applications:
  - name: my-app-name
```

#### <a id='godeps_1.6'></a>Go 1.6 ####
* [Sample Go 1.6 app](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-buildpack/tree/master/cf_spec/fixtures/go_16_app/src/go_app)

An example `Godeps/Godeps.json`:

```json
{
    "ImportPath": "go_app",
    "GoVersion": "go1.6",
    "Deps": []
}
```

### <a id='with_glide'></a>Push an App with Glide ###
If you use [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) to specify or package your dependencies, make sure that you have created a valid `glide.yml` file in the root directory of your app by running `glide init`.

To vendor your dependencies before pushing, run `glide install`. This will generate a `vendor` directory and a `glide.lock` file specifying the latest compatible versions of your dependencies. You must have a `glide.lock` file when pushing a vendored app. You do not need a `glide.lock` file when deploying a non-vendored app. 

####<a id='glide_app'></a>Glide####
* [Sample Go app with Glide](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-buildpack/tree/master/cf_spec/fixtures/go_app_with_glide/src/go_app_with_glide)

An example `glide.yml` file:

```yaml
package: go_app_with_glide
import:
- package: github.com/ZiCog/shiny-thing
  subpackages:
  - foo
```

### <a id='pushing_Apps_with_native_Go_vendoring'></a>Push an App with Native Go Vendoring ###
If you use the native Go vendoring system, which packages all local dependencies in the `vendor/` directory, you must specify your app's package name in the `GOPACKAGENAME` environment variable. 

An example `manifest.yml`:

```yaml
---
applications:
  - name: my-app-name
    command: go-online
    env:
      GOPACKAGENAME: app-package-name
```

#### <a id='go 1.5'></a>Go 1.5 ####
<p class='note'><strong>NOTE</strong>: For Go 1.5, native vendoring is disabled by default. You must set the <code>GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT</code> environment variable to <code>1</code> in your <code>manifest.yml</code> file to use this native vendoring.</p>

If you use the `vendor/` directory for dependencies, you can set the Go version with the `GOVERSION` environment variable.

An example `manifest.yml` file:

```yaml
---
applications:
  - name: my-app-name
    env:
      GOVERSION: go1.5
      GOPACKAGENAME: app-package-name
      GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT: 1
```

#### <a id='go_1.6'></a>Go 1.6 ####
* [Sample Go 1.6 app with native vendoring](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-buildpack/tree/develop/cf_spec/fixtures/go_with_native_vendoring/src/go_app).

Go 1.6 has vendoring enabled by default. Set the `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT` environment variable to `0` to disable vendoring.

An example `manifest.yml` file:

```yaml
---
applications:
 - name: my-app-name
   command: example-project
   env:
     GOVERSION: go1.6
     GOPACKAGENAME: app-package-name
```

#### <a id='godeps_1.7'></a>Go 1.7+ ####

* [Sample Go 1.7 app with native vendoring](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-buildpack/tree/master/cf_spec/fixtures/go_app_gopath_in_container/src/go_app).

Go 1.7 always has vendoring enabled, and you cannot disable it with an environment variable.

An example `manifest.yml`:

```yaml
---
applications:
 - name: my-app-name
   command: example-project
   env:
     GOVERSION: go1.7
     GOPACKAGENAME: app-package-name
```

## <a id='passing_symbol_linker'></a>Pass a Symbol and String to the Linker ##

The Go buildpack supports the Go [linker's](https://golang.org/cmd/link/) ability, `-X symbol value`, to set the value of a string at link time. Set the `GO_LINKER_SYMBOL` and `GO_LINKER_VALUE` in the application's configuration  before pushing code.

This can be used to embed the commit SHA or other build-specific data directly
into the compiled executable.

For example usage, see the relevant [fixture app](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-buildpack/tree/develop/cf_spec/fixtures/go1.6_app_using_ldflags/src/go_app).

## <a id='c_dependencies'></a>C Dependencies ##

The Go buildpack supports building with C dependencies using [cgo](https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/). You can set config vars to specify cgo flags
to, for example, specify paths for vendored dependencies. As an example, to build [gopgsqldriver](https://github.com/jbarham/gopgsqldriver), add the config var `CGO_CFLAGS` with the value `-I/app/code/vendor/include/postgresql` and include the relevant Postgres header files in `vendor/include/postgresql/` in your app.

## <a id='proxy_support'></a> Proxy Support ##

If you need to use a proxy to download dependencies during staging, you can set
the `http_proxy` and/or `https_proxy` environment variables. For more information, see the [Proxy Usage](../proxy-usage.html) topic.

## <a id='bosh_trusted_cert'></a>BOSH Configured Custom Trusted Certificate Support ##

Go uses certificates stored in `/etc/ssl/certs` and supports [BOSH configured custom trusted certificates](http://bosh.io/docs/trusted-certs.html) with no additional configuration necessary.
