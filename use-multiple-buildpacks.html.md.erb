You can push an app with multiple buildpacks using the Tanzu cf CLI.

As an alternative to the cf CLI procedure, you can specify multiple
buildpacks in your app manifest. This is not compatible with deprecated app manifest features. For more information, see <a href="../devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html">Deploying with App Manifests</a>.

For more information about pushing apps, see [Pushing an App](../devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html).


## <a id='cfcli'></a> Specifying buildpacks with the Tanzu cf CLI

To push an app with multiple buildpacks using the cf CLI:

<p class="note">
You must use Tanzu cf CLI v10 or later.</p>

1. Ensure that you are using Tanzu cf CLI v10 or later by running:

    ```console
    cf version
    ```
    For more information about upgrading the cf CLI, see [Installing the Tanzu cf CLI](../operating/cf-cli/install-cf-cli.html).

2. To push your app with multiple buildpacks, specify each buildpack with a `-b` flag by running:

    ```console
    cf push YOUR-APP -b BUILDPACK-NAME-1 -b BUILDPACK-NAME-2 ... -b BUILDPACK-NAME-3
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>YOUR-APP</code> is the name of your app.</li>
      <li><code>BUILDPACK-NAME-1</code>, <code>BUILDPACK-NAME-2</code>, and <code>BUILDPACK-NAME-3</code> are the names of the buildpacks you want to push with your app.</li>
    </ul>

    The last buildpack you specify is the **final buildpack**, which modifies the launch environment and sets the start command.

    To see a list of available buildpacks, run:

    ```console
    cf buildpacks
    ```
