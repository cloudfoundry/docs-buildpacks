When you push an app, Cloud Foundry uses a detection process to determine which buildpack to use. 
For general information about this process, see [How Applications Are Staged](../concepts/how-applications-are-staged.html#stage-buildpack). 

During staging, each buildpack has a position in a priority list (identified by running `cf buildpacks`). 
Cloud Foundry checks if the buildpack in position 1 is a compatible buildpack. 
If the position 1 buildpack is not compatible, Cloud Foundry moves on to the buildpack in position 2. 
Cloud Foundry continues this process until the correct buildpack is found. If no buildpack is compatible `cf push` fails with the following error:

<pre class="terminal">
None of the buildpacks detected a compatible application
Exit status 222
Staging failed: Exited with status 222

FAILED
NoAppDetectedError
</pre>
