<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to upgrade a dependency version in a custom buildpack. These procedures enable Cloud Foundry (CF) operators to maintain custom buildpacks that contain dependencies outside of the dependencies in the CF system buildpacks.

##<a id="buildpacks-team"></a>Cloud Foundry Buildpacks Team Process

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The procedures in this topic refer to the tools used by the CF buildpacks team, but they do not require the specific tools listed below. You can use any continuous integration (CI) system and workflow management tool to update dependencies in custom buildpacks.</p>

The CF buildpacks team uses the following tools to update dependencies:

* A [Concourse](https://concourse.ci) deployment of the [buildpacks-ci](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/buildpacks-ci) pipelines
* The [public-buildpacks-ci-robots](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/public-buildpacks-ci-robots) GitHub repository
* [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com) for workflow management

When the [New Releases](https://buildpacks.ci.cf-app.com/pipelines/notifications/jobs/New%20Releases) job in the [notifications pipeline](https://buildpacks.ci.cf-app.com/pipelines/notifications)
detects a new version of a tracked dependency in a buildpack, it creates a [Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com) story about building and including the new version of the dependency in the buildpack manifests. It also posts a message as the `dependency-notifier` to the [#buildpacks channel](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com/messages/buildpacks/) in the Cloud Foundry Slack channel.

##<a id="building"></a>Build the Binaries

For all dependencies, you must build the binary from source or acquire the binary as a tarball from a trusted source. For most dependencies, the CF buildpacks team builds the binaries from source.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The steps below assume you are using a Concourse deployment of the <code>buildpacks-ci</code> pipelines and Pivotal Tracker.</p>

To build the binary for a dependency, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the `public-buildpacks-ci-robots` directory and verify no uncommitted changes exist.
  <pre class='terminal'>
  $ cd ~/workspace/public-buildpacks-ci-robots
  $ git status
  </pre>
1. Run the `git pull` command in the directory to ensure it contains most recent version of the contents.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ git pull -r
  </pre>
1. Navigate to the `binary-builds` directory.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cd binary-builds
  </pre>
1. Locate the YAML file for the buildpack you want to build a binary for. The directory contains YAML files for all the packages and dependencies tracked by the CF buildpacks team. Each YAML file correlates to the build queue for one dependency or package, and uses the naming format `DEPENDENCY-NAME.yml`. For example, the YAML file tracking the build queue for Ruby is named `ruby-builds.yml` and contains the following contents:

    ```yaml
    ---
    ruby: []
    ```

1. Different buildpacks use different signatures for verification. Determine which signature your buildpack requires by consulting the list in the [buildpacks](#buildpacks) section of this topic and run follow the instructions to locate the SHA256, MD5, or GPG signature for the binary:
  * For the SHA256 of a file, run `shasum -a 256 FILE-NAME`.
  * For the MD5 of a file, run `md5 FILE-NAME`.
  * For the GPG signature (for Nginx), see the [Nginx Downloads](http://nginx.org/en/download.html) page.

1. Add the version and verification for the new binary to the YAML file as attributes of an element under the dependency name. For example, to build the Ruby 2.3.0 binary verified with SHA256, add the following to the YAML file:

    ```yaml
    ---
    ruby:
    - version: 2.3.0
      sha256: ba5ba60e5f1aa21b4ef8e9bf35b9ddb57286cb546aac4b5a28c71f459467e507
    ```

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Do not preface the version number with the name of the binary or language. For example, specify <code>2.3.0</code> for <code>version</code> instead of <code>ruby-2.3.0</code>.</p>

    You can enqueue builds for multiple versions at the same time. For example, to build both the Ruby 2.3.0 binary and the Ruby 2.3.1 binary, add the following to the YAML file:

    ```yaml
    ---
    ruby:
    - version: 2.3.0
      sha256: ba5ba60e5f1aa21b4ef8e9bf35b9ddb57286cb546aac4b5a28c71f459467e507
    - version: 2.3.1
      sha256: b87c738cb2032bf4920fef8e3864dc5cf8eae9d89d8d523ce0236945c5797dcd
    ```

1. Use the `git add` command to stage your changes:

    <pre class="terminal">$ git add .</pre>

1. Use the `git commit -m "YOUR-COMMIT-MESSAGE [#STORY-NUMBER]"` command to commit your changes using the Tracker story number. Replace `YOUR-COMMIT-MESSAGE` with your commit message, and `STORY-NUMBER` with the number of your Tracker story.

    <pre class="terminal">$ git commit -m "make that change [#1234567890]"</pre>

1. Run `git push` to push your changes to the remote origin.

    <pre class="terminal">$ git push</pre>

1. Pushing your changes triggers the binary building process, which you can  monitor at the [binary-builder pipeline](https://buildpacks.ci.cf-app.com/pipelines/binary-builder)
of your own `buildpacks-ci` Concourse deployment. When the build completes, it adds a link to the Concourse build run to the Tracker story specified in the commit message for the new release.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Binary builds are executed by the Cloud Foundry <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/binary-builder">Binary Builder</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/buildpacks-ci/blob/master/pipelines/binary-builder.yml">binary-builder pipeline</a>.</p>

##<a id="manifest-updates"></a>Update Buildpack Manifests

After you build the binary for a dependency that you can access and download from a URL, follow the instructions below to add the dependency version to the buildpack manifest.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The steps below assume you are using a Concourse deployment of the <code>buildpacks-ci</code> pipelines and Pivotal Tracker.</p>

1. Navigate to the directory of the buildpack for which you want to update dependencies and run `git checkout develop` to check out the `develop` branch.
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cd ~/workspace/ruby-buildpack
    $ git checkout develop
    </pre>

1. Edit the `manifest.yml` file for the buildpack to add or remove dependencies.

    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      - name: ruby
        version: 2.3.0
        md5: 535342030a11abeb11497824bf642bf2
        uri: https://pivotal-buildpacks.s3.amazonaws.com/concourse-binaries/ruby/ruby-2.3.0-linux-x64.tgz
        cf_stacks:
          - cflinuxfs2
    ```
    * Follow the current structure of the manifest. For example, if the manifest includes the two most recent patch versions for each minor version of the language, you should also include the two most recent patch versions for each minor version of the language, such as both `ruby-2.1.9` and `ruby-2.1.8`.
    * Copy the `uri` and the `md5` from the `build-BINARY-NAME` job that ran in the Concourse binary-builder pipeline and add them to the manifest.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: In the PHP buildpack, you may see a <code>modules</code> line for each PHP dependency in the manifest. Do not include this <code>modules</code> line in your new PHP dependency entry. The <code>modules</code> line will be added to the manifest by the <code>ensure-manifest-has-modules</code> Concourse job in the <code>php-buildpack</code> when you commit and push your changes. You can see this in the output logs of the <code>build-out</code> task.</p>

1. Replace any other mentions of the old version number in the buildpack repository with the new version number. The CF buildpack team uses [Ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) for text searching.

    <pre class="terminal">$ ag OLD-VERSION</pre>

1. Run the following command to package and upload the buildpack, set up the org and space for tests in the specified CF deployment, and run the CF buildpack tests.

    <pre class="terminal">$ BUNDLE_GEMFILE=cf.Gemfile buildpack-build</pre>

    If the command fails, you may need to fix or change the tests, fixtures, or other parts of the buildpack.

1. Once the test suite completely passes, use git commands to stage, commit, and push your changes:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "YOUR-MESSAGE[#TRACKER-STORY-ID]"
    $ git push
    </pre>

1. Monitor the `LANGUAGE-buildpack` pipeline in Concourse. Once the test suite builds, the `specs-lts-develop` job and `specs-edge-develop` job, pass for the buildpack, you can deliver the Tracker story for the new Dependency release. Copy and paste links for the successful test suite builds into the Tracker story.

__Composer__:

* **Verified with**: The SHA256 of the `composer.phar` file from the [Composer Downloads](https://getcomposer.org/download/) page
* For Composer, there is no build process as the `composer.phar` file is the binary. In the manual process, connect to the `pivotal-buildpacks` S3 bucket using the correct AWS credentials. Create a new directory with the name of the
composer version, for example `1.0.2`, and put the appropriate `composer.phar` file into that directory. For Composer `v1.0.2`, connect and create the `php/binaries/trusty/composer/1.0.2` directory. Then place the `composer.phar` file into that directory so the binary is available at `php/binaries/trusty/composer/1.0.2/composer.phar`.
