Cloud Foundry can deploy a number of different JVM-based artifact types.
For a more detailed explanation of what it supports, see the [Java Buildpack documentation][d].

## Java Client Library  ##

The Cloud Foundry Client Library provides a Java API for interacting with a
Cloud Foundry instance.
This library, `cloudfoundry-client-lib`, is used by the Cloud Foundry Maven
plugin, the Cloud Foundry Gradle plugin, the [Cloud Foundry STS integration](./sts.html), and other Java-based tools.

For information about using this library, see the [Java Cloud Foundry Library](./java-client.html) page.

## <a id='grails'></a>Grails ##
Grails packages applications into WAR files for deployment into a Servlet
container.
To build the WAR file and deploy it, run the following:

<pre class="terminal">
$ grails prod war
$ cf push my-application -p target/my-application-version.war
</pre>

## <a id='groovy'></a>Groovy ##
Groovy applications based on both [Ratpack][r] and a simple collection of files
are supported.

### <a id='ratpack'></a>Ratpack ###
Ratpack packages applications into two different styles; Cloud Foundry supports
the `distZip` style. To build the ZIP and deploy it, run the following:

<pre class="terminal">
$ gradle distZip
$ cf push my-application -p build/distributions/my-application.zip
</pre>

### <a id='raw-groovy'></a>Raw Groovy ###
Groovy applications that are made up of a [single entry point][g] plus any
supporting files can be run without any other work.
To deploy them, run the following:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-application
</pre>

## <a id='java-main'></a>Java Main ##
Java applications with a `main()` method can be run provided that they are
packaged as [self-executable JARs][j].

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If your application is not web-enabled, you must suppress route creation to avoid a "failed to start accepting connections" error. To suppress route creation, add <code>no-route: true</code> to the application manifest or use the <code>--no-route</code> flag with the <code>cf push</code> command. <br><br>For more information about the <code>no-route</code> attribute, see the <a href="../../devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html#no-route">Deploying with Application Manifests</a> topic.</p>

### <a id='java-main-maven'></a>Maven ###
A Maven build can create a self-executable JAR.
To build and deploy the JAR, run the following:

<pre class="terminal">
$ mvn package
$ cf push my-application -p target/my-application-version.jar
</pre>

### <a id='java-main-gradle'></a>Gradle ###
A Gradle build can create a self-executable JAR.
To build and deploy the JAR, run the following:

<pre class="terminal">
$ gradle build
$ cf push my-application -p build/libs/my-application-version.jar
</pre>

## <a id='play-framework'></a>Play Framework ##
The [Play Framework][p] packages applications into two different styles.
Cloud Foundry supports both the `staged` and `dist` styles. To build the `dist`
style and deploy it, run the following:

<pre class="terminal">
$ play dist
$ cf push my-application -p target/universal/my-application-version.zip
</pre>

## <a id='spring-boot-cli'></a>Spring Boot CLI ##
[Spring Boot][s] can run applications [comprised entirely of POGOs][b].
To deploy then, run the following:

<pre class="terminal">
$ spring grab *.groovy
$ cf push my-application
</pre>

## <a id='servlet'></a>Servlet ##
Java applications can be packaged as Servlet applications.

### <a id='servlet-maven'></a>Maven ###
A Maven build can create a Servlet WAR.
To build and deploy the WAR, run the following:

<pre class="terminal">
$ mvn package
$ cf push my-application -p target/my-application-version.war
</pre>

### <a id='servlet-gradle'></a>Gradle ###
A Gradle build can create a Servlet WAR.
To build and deploy the JAR, run the following:

<pre class="terminal">
$ gradle build
$ cf push my-application -p build/libs/my-application-version.war
</pre>

## <a id='services'></a>Binding to Services ##
Information about binding apps to services can be found on the following pages:

* [Service Bindings for Grails Applications](./grails-service-bindings.html)
* [Service Bindings for Play Framework Applications](./play-service-bindings.html)
* [Service Bindings for Spring Applications](./spring-service-bindings.html)

## <a id='buildpack'></a>Java Buildpack ##

For detailed information about using, configuring, and extending the Cloud
Foundry Java buildpack, see [https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack).

## <a id='design'></a>Design ##
The Java Buildpack is designed to convert artifacts that run on the JVM into
executable applications.
It does this by identifying one of the supported artifact types (Grails, Groovy,
Java, Play Framework, Spring Boot, and Servlet) and downloading all additional
dependencies needed to run.
The collection of services bound to the application is also analyzed and any
dependencies related to those services are also downloaded.

As an example, pushing a WAR file that is bound to a PostgreSQL database and New
Relic for performance monitoring would result in the following:

<pre class="terminal">

</pre>

## <a id='configuration'></a>Configuration ##
In most cases, the buildpack should work without any configuration.
If you are new to Cloud Foundry, we recommend that you make your first attempts
without modifying the buildpack configuration.
If the buildpack requires some configuration, use [a fork of the buildpack][f].

## <a id='java-apps'></a>Java and Grails Best Practices ##

### <a id='jdbc'></a>Provide JDBC driver ###

The Java buildpack does not bundle a JDBC driver with your application.
If your application will access a SQL RDBMS, include the appropriate driver in
your application.

### <a id='memory'></a>Allocate Sufficient Memory ###

If you do not allocate sufficient memory to a Java application when you deploy
it, it may fail to start, or <%=vars.product_short%> may terminate it.
You must allocate enough memory to allow for the following:

* Java heap
* Metaspace, if using Java 8
* PermGen, if using Java 7 or earlier
* Stack size per Thread
* JVM overhead

The `config/open_jdk_jre.yml` file of the [Cloud Foundry Java buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack) contains default
memory size and weighting settings for the JRE.
See the [Open JDK JRE README](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/blob/master/docs/jre-open_jdk_jre.md) on GitHub for an explanation of JRE memory sizes and weightings and
how the Java buildpack calculates and allocates memory to the JRE for your app.

To configure memory-related JRE options for your app, you either create a custom buildpack and specify this buildpack in your deployment manifest 
or you override the default memory settings of your buildpack as described 
[here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack#configuration-and-extension)
with the properties listed  in the [Open JDK JRE README](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/blob/master/docs/jre-open_jdk_jre.md).
For more information about configuring custom buildpacks and manifests, refer to
the [Custom Buildpacks](../../buildpacks/custom.html) and [Deploying with
Application Manifests](../../devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html) topics.

When your app is running, you can use the `cf app APP-NAME` command to see
memory utilization.

### <a id='memory-troubleshoot'></a>Troubleshoot Out Of Memory ###

A Java app may crash because of insufficient memory on the Garden container or the JVM on which it runs. See the following sections for help diagnosing and resolving such issues.

#### JVM 

* **Error**: `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError`. See the following example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf logs APP-NAME --recent
    2016-06-20T09:18:51.00+0100 [APP/0] OUT java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Metaspace   
    </pre>
* **Cause**: If the JVM cannot garbage-collect enough space to ensure the allocation of a data-structure, it fails with [java.lang.OutOfMemoryError](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/OutOfMemoryError.html). In the example above, JVM has an under-sized `metaspace`. You may see failures in other memory pools, such as `heap`.
* **Solution**: Configure the JVM correctly for your app. See [Allocate Sufficient Memory](#memory).

#### Garden Container

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The solutions in this section require configuring the memory calculator, which is a sub-project of the CF Java buildpack that calculates suitable memory settings for Java apps when you push them. See the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack-memory-calculator">java-buildpack-memory-calculator</a> repository for more information. If you have questions about the memory calculator, you can ask them in the <b>#java-buildpack</b> channel of the <a href="https://cloundfoundry.slack.com">Cloud Foundry</a> Slack organization.</p>

* **Error**: The Garden container terminates the Java process with the `out of memory` event. See the following example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf events APP-NAME
    time                          event         actor         description
    2016-06-20T09:18:51.00+0100   app.crash     app-name      index: 0, reason: CRASHED, exit\_description: out of memory, exit\_status: 255
    </pre>

    This error appears when the JVM allocates more OS-level memory than the quota requested by the app, such as [through the manifest](../../devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html#memory).

* **Cause 1 - Insufficient native memory**: This error commonly means that the JVM requires more `native` memory. In the scope of the Java buildpack and the memory calculator, the term `native` means the memory required for the JVM to work, along with forms of memory not covered in the other classifications of the memory calculator. This includes the memory footprint of OS-level threads, [direct NIO buffers](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html), code cache, program counters, and others.

* **Solution 1**: Determine how much `native` memory a Java app needs by [measuring it](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/troubleshoot/tooldescr007.html) with realistic workloads and fine-tuning it accordingly.
You can then configure the Java buildpack using the `native` [setting](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/blob/master/docs/jre-open_jdk_jre.md#memory-sizes) of the memory calculator, as in the example below:

    ```
    ---
    applications:
    - name: app-name
      memory: 1G
      env:
        JBP_CONFIG_OPEN_JDK_JRE: '[memory_calculator: {memory_sizes: {native: 150m}}]'
    ```

    This example shows that `150m` of the overall available `1G` is reserved for anything that is not `heap`, `metaspace`, or `permgen`. In less common cases, this may come from companion processes started by the JVM, such as the [Process API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Process.html).

* **Cause 2 - High thread count**: Java threads in the JVM can cause memory errors at the Garden level. When an app is under heavy load, it uses a high number of threads and consumes a significant amount of memory.

* **Solution 2**: Set the reserved memory for stack traces to the correct value for your app.
<br>
<br>You can use the `stack` [setting](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/blob/master/docs/jre-open_jdk_jre.md#memory-sizes) of the memory calculator to configure the amount of space the JVM reserves for each Java thread. You must multiply this value by the number of threads your app requires. Specify the number of threads in the `stack_threads` [setting](https://github.com/jdeoliveira/mule-cf-java-buildpack/blob/master/docs/jre-open_jdk_jre.md#memory) of the memory calculator.
    For example, if you estimate the max thread count for an app at `800` and the amount of memory needed to represent the deepest stacktrace of a Java thread is `512KB`, configure the memory calculator as follows:

    ```
    ---
    applications:
    - name: app-name
      memory: 1G
      env:
        JBP_CONFIG_OPEN_JDK_JRE: '[memory_calculator: {stack_threads: 800, memory_sizes: {stack: 512k}}]'
    ```

    In this example, the overall memory amount reserved by the JVM for representing the stacks of Java threads is `800 * 512k = 400m`.
    <br><br>
    The correct settings for `stack` and `stack_threads` depend on your app code, including the libraries it uses. Your app may technically have no upper limit, such as in the case of [cavalier usage](http://dev.bizo.com/2014/06/cached-thread-pool-considered-harmlful.html) of `CachedThreadPool` [executors](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html#newCachedThreadPool--).
    However, you still must calculate the depth of the thread stacks and the amount of space the JVM should reserve for each of them.

### <a id='upload'></a>Troubleshoot Failed Upload ###

If your application fails to upload when you push it to Cloud Foundry, it may be
for one of the following reasons:

* **WAR is too large**: An upload may fail due to the size of the WAR file.
Cloud Foundry testing indicates WAR files as large as 250 MB upload
successfully.
If a WAR file larger than that fails to upload, it may be a result of the file
size.

* **Connection issues**: Application uploads can fail if you have a slow Internet connection, or if you upload from a location that is very remote from the target Cloud Foundry instance.
If an application upload takes a long time, your authorization token can expire
before the upload completes.
A workaround is to copy the WAR to a server that is closer to the Cloud Foundry
instance, and push it from there.

* **Out-of-date cf CLI client**: Upload of a large WAR is faster and hence less
likely to fail if you are using a recent version of the cf CLI.
If you are using an older version of the cf CLI client to upload a large WAR, and having
problems, try updating to the latest version of the cf CLI.

* **Incorrect WAR targeting**: By default, `cf push` uploads everything in the
current directory.
For a Java application, `cf push` with no option flags uploads source code and other unnecessary files, in addition to the WAR.
When you push a Java application, specify the path to the WAR:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf push MY-APP -p PATH/TO/WAR-FILE
    </pre>

    You can determine whether or not the path was specified for a previously
    pushed application by examining the application deployment manifest,
    `manifest.yml`.
    If the `path` attribute specifies the current directory, the manifest
    includes a line like the following:

    ```
    path: .
    ```
    To re-push just the WAR, do one of the following:

    * Delete `manifest.yml` and run `cf push` again, specifying the location of 
    the WAR using the `-p` flag.
    * Edit the `path` argument in `manifest.yml` to point to the WAR, and
    re-push the application.

### <a id='debugging'></a>Debug Java Apps on Cloud Foundry ###

Because of the way that Cloud Foundry deploys your applications and isolates them, it is not possible to connect to your application with the remote Java debugger. Instead, instruct the application to connect to the Java debugger on your local machine.

Here are the instructions for setting up remote debugging when using BOSH Lite or a CloudFoundry installation.

1. Open your project in [Eclipse](./sts.html).
1. Right-click on your project, go to **Debug as** and pick **Debug Configurations**.
1. Create a new **Remote Java Application**.
1. Make sure your project is selected, pick **Standard (Socket Listen)** from the **Connection Type** drop down and set a port. Make sure this port is open if you are running a firewall.
1. Click **Debug**.

The debugger should now be running. If you switch to the Debug perspective, you should see your application listed in the Debug panel and it should say `Waiting for vm to connect at port`.

Next, push your application to Cloud Foundry and instruct Cloud Foundry to connect to the debugger running on your local machine using the following instructions:

1. Edit your `manifest.yml` file. Set the instances count to 1. If you set this greater than one, multiple applications try to connect to your debugger.
1. Also in `manifest.yml`, add the [`env` section](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html#env-block) and create a variable called `JAVA_OPTS`.
1. Add the remote debugger configuration to the `JAVA_OPTS` variable: `-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=YOUR-IP-ADDRESS:YOUR-PORT`.
1. Save the `manifest.yml` file.
1. Run `cf push`.

Upon completion, you should see that your application has started and is now connected to the debugger running in your IDE. You can now add breakpoints and interrogate the application just as you would if it were running locally.

### <a id='slow-start'></a>Slow Starting Java or Grails Apps ###

Some Java and Grails applications do not start quickly, and the health check
for an application can fail if an application starts too slowly.

The current Java buildpack implementation sets the Tomcat `bindOnInit` property
to `false`. This prevents Tomcat from listening for HTTP requests until an
application has fully deployed.

If your application does not start quickly, the health check may fail
because it checks the health of the application before the application can
accept requests.
By default, the health check fails after a timeout threshold of 60 seconds.

To resolve this issue, use `cf push APP-NAME` with the `-t TIMEOUT-THRESHOLD`
option to increase the timeout threshold. Specify `TIMEOUT-THRESHOLD` in seconds.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-app -t 180
</pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The timeout threshold cannot exceed 180 seconds. Specifying a timeout threshold greater than 180 seconds results in the following error: <code>Server error, status code: 400, error code: 100001, message: The app is invalid: health_check_timeout maximum_exceeded</code></p>

## <a id='extension'></a>Extension ##
The Java Buildpack is also designed to be easily extended.
It creates abstractions for [three types of components][a] (containers,
frameworks, and JREs) in order to allow users to easily add functionality.
In addition to these abstractions, there are a number of [utility classes][e]
for simplifying typical buildpack behaviors.

As an example, the New Relic framework looks like the following:

```ruby
class NewRelicAgent < JavaBuildpack::Component::VersionedDependencyComponent

  # @macro base_component_compile
  def compile
    FileUtils.mkdir_p logs_dir

    download_jar
    @droplet.copy_resources
  end

  # @macro base_component_release
  def release
    @droplet.java_opts
    .add_javaagent(@droplet.sandbox + jar_name)
    .add_system_property('newrelic.home', @droplet.sandbox)
    .add_system_property('newrelic.config.license_key', license_key)
    .add_system_property('newrelic.config.app_name', "'#{application_name}'")
    .add_system_property('newrelic.config.log_file_path', logs_dir)
  end

  protected

  # @macro versioned_dependency_component_supports
  def supports?
    @application.services.one_service? FILTER, 'licenseKey'
  end

  private

  FILTER = /newrelic/.freeze

  def application_name
    @application.details['application_name']
  end

  def license_key
    @application.services.find_service(FILTER)['credentials']['licenseKey']
  end

  def logs_dir
    @droplet.sandbox + 'logs'
  end

end
```

## <a id='env-var'></a>Environment Variables ##

You can access environments variable programmatically.

For example, you can obtain `VCAP_SERVICES` as follows:

```
System.getenv("VCAP_SERVICES");
```

See the [Cloud Foundry Environment Variables](../../devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html) topic for more information.
