title: Java Buildpack

Use the Java buildpack with applications written in Grails, Play, Spring or any
other JVM-based language or framework.

## Buildpack Logging and Application Logging ##

The buildpack only runs during the staging process, and therefore only logs
what is important to staging, such as what is being downloaded, what the
configuration is, and work that the buildpack does on your application.

The Java buildpack source documentation states:

* The Java buildpack logs all messages, regardless of severity to
`<app dir>/.java-buildpack.log`.
	It also logs messages to `$stderr`, filtered by a configured severity.

* If the buildpack fails with an exception, the exception message is logged with a
log level of `ERROR` whereas the exception stack trace is logged with a log level
of `DEBUG` to prevent users from seeing stack traces by default.

Once staging is done, the buildpack stops logging.
Application logging is a separate concern.

Your application must write to STDOUT or STDERR for its logs to be included in the
Loggregator stream.
See [Application Logging in Cloud Foundry](../../devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html).
