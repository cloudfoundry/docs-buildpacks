title: Buildpacks
---

Buildpacks provide framework and runtime support for your applications.
Buildpacks typically examine user-provided artifacts to determine what dependencies to download and how to configure applications to communicate with bound services.

When you push an application, Cloud Foundry automatically [detects](./detection.html) which buildpack is required and installs it on the Droplet Execution Agent (DEA) where the application needs to run.

Cloud Foundry has four **system buildpacks**:

* [Java](./java/) for applications written in Java, Grails, Play, Spring or any other JVM-based language or framework
* [Node.js](./node/) for applications written in Node or JavaScript
* [Ruby](./ruby/) for applications written in Ruby, Rack, Rails or Sinatra
* [Go](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-buildpack-go) for applications written in Go.

If your application uses a language or framework that Cloud Foundry buildpacks do not support, there are several options you can try:

* [Customize](./custom.html) an existing buildpack or write your own
* Use a [Cloud Foundry Community Buildpack][c]
* Use a [Heroku Third-Party Buildpack][h] (these may work with Cloud Foundry but have not been verified to do so)

Heroku developed the buildpack approach and made it available to the open source community.
