title: Buildpacks
---

Buildpacks provide framework and runtime support for your applications.
Buildpacks typically examine user-provided artifacts to determine what dependencies to download and how to configure applications to communicate with bound services.

When you push an application, Cloud Foundry automatically [detects](./detection.html) which buildpack is required and installs it on the Droplet Execution Agent (DEA) where the application needs to run.

## System Buildpacks

Cloud Foundry has four system buildpacks:

* [Java](./java/) for applications written in Java, Grails, Play, Spring or any other JVM-based language or framework
* [Node.js](./node/) for applications written in Node or JavaScript
* [Ruby](./ruby/) for applications written in Ruby, Rack, Rails or Sinatra
* [Go](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-buildpack-go) for applications written in Go.
* [PHP](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-buildpack-php) for applications written in PHP
* [Python](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-buildpack-python) for applications written in Python

## Other Buildpacks

If your application uses a language or framework that Cloud Foundry buildpacks do not support, there are several options you can try:

* [Customize](./custom.html) an existing buildpack or write your own
* Use a [Cloud Foundry Community Buildpack][c]
* Use a [Heroku Third-Party Buildpack][h] (these may work with Cloud Foundry but have not been verified to do so)

[c]: https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/cf-docs-contrib/wiki/Buildpacks
[h]: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/third-party-buildpacks

Heroku developed the buildpack approach and made it available to the open source community.

Cloud Foundry deploys often have limited access to dependencies. This occurs when the deploy is behind a firewall, or
when administrators want to use local mirrors/proxies. In these circumstances, Cloud Foundry provides an
[API extension for on-premises buildpacks](./custom.html#package-script).
