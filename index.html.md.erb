title: Buildpacks
---

Buildpacks provide framework and runtime support for your applications.
Buildpacks typically examine user-provided artifacts to determine what dependencies to download and how to configure applications to communicate with bound services. 

When you push an application, Cloud Foundry automatically [detects](./detection.html) which buildpack is required and installs it on the Droplet Execution Agent (DEA) where the application needs to run.

Cloud Foundry deployments often have limited access to dependencies. This occurs when the deploy is behind a firewall, or
when administrators want to use local mirrors and proxies. In these circumstances, Cloud Foundry provides an
[API extension for on-premises buildpacks](./custom.html#package-script).

## System Buildpacks

This table describes Cloud Foundry system buildpacks. Each buildpack row lists supported languages and frameworks and includes a GitHub repo link. Specific buildpack names also link to additional documentation.

## Other Buildpacks

If your application uses a language or framework that Cloud Foundry buildpacks do not support, you can try the following:

* [Customize](./custom.html) an existing buildpack
* Write your own buildpack
* Use a [Cloud Foundry Community Buildpack][c]
* Use a [Heroku Third-Party Buildpack][h]
