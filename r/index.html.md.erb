You can push your R app to Cloud Foundry and configure your R app to use the R buildpack.

Cloud Foundry automatically uses the R buildpack if it detects a
`r.yml` file in the root directory of your project.

If your Cloud Foundry deployment does not have the R buildpack installed, or the installed version is out of date,
you can use the latest version by specifying it with the `-b` option when you push your app.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my_app -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/r-buildpack.git
</pre>

## <a id="supported_versions"></a> Supported versions

You can find the list of supported R versions in the
[R buildpack release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/r-buildpack/releases).


## <a id="start_command"></a>Start command

The R buildpack does not generate a default start command for your applications. Instead, you must specify a start command for your app.

To stage an app with the R buildpack and start the app, do one of the following:

- **Option 1:**  Supply a Procfile. For more information about Procfiles, see [Production Server Configuration](../prod-server.html). The following example Procfile specifies `R -f` as the start command for a web app with the entrypoint `simple.r`:

    ```
    web: R -f simple.r
    ```

- **Option 2:** Specify a start command with `-c`:

    ```
    $ cf push r-app -c "R -f simple.r"
    ```

- **Option 3:** Specify a start command in the application manifest by setting the `command` attribute. For more information, see the [Deploying with Application Manifests](../../devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html#start-commands) topic.

For more information about starting apps,
see [Starting, Restarting, and Restaging Applications](../../devguide/deploy-apps/start-restart-restage.html).

## <a id="specifying_dependencies"></a> Specifying app dependencies

As of v1.1.21, the following packages are provided by the R buildpack:

- Rserve
- forecast
- plumber
- shiny

To specify additional packages needed by your app, provide the CRAN mirror and names of the packages inside your `r.yml` file. You can also specify the number of threads to use for parallel installation. For example:

```
---
packages:
  - cran_mirror: https://cran.r-project.org
    num_threads: 2
    packages:
      - name: stringr
      - name: jsonlite
```

## <a id="vendoring"></a> Vendoring app dependencies

If you are deploying in an environment that is disconnected from the Internet, you must _vendor_ your app's dependencies, which means you must make these packages available for offline use. You can vendor dependencies by using a package manager.

To set up your own custom, local CRAN-like repository to vendor your packages, create the `src/contrib` directories and populate them with your package source tarballs. For more information, see [How to Set Up a Custom CRAN-like Repository](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/custom-repos.html) published on the _Packrat Documentation_ site.

Add the `src/contrib` directories containing your package tarballs to a `vendor_r` directory at the root of your app. This directory is named `vendor_r` so as not to conflict with vendor directories of other languages, such as python.

Then, inside your `r.yml`, provide the names of your vendored packages in the `packages` list:

<pre class="terminal">
---
packages:
  - packages:
      - name: stringr
      - name: jsonlite
</pre>

`cf push` uploads your vendored dependencies. The buildpack installs them directly from the `vendor_r/` directory.

Example app directory tree:

```
├── r.yml
├── simple-app.r
└── vendor_r
    └── src
        └── contrib
            ├── PACKAGES
            ├── PACKAGES.gz
            ├── jsonlite_1.5.tar.gz
            └── stringr_1.3.1.tar.gz
```

For more information about using buildpacks in disconnected environments, see [Disconnected environments](https://github.com/cf-buildpacks/buildpack-packager/blob/master/doc/disconnected_environments.md).

## <a id="proxy_support"></a> Proxy support

If you need to use a proxy to download dependencies during staging, you can set
the `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` environment variables. For more information, see [Using a Proxy](../proxy-usage.html).


## <a id="bosh_trusted_cert"></a> BOSH configured custom trusted certificate support

R uses certificates stored in `/etc/ssl/certs`. Your platform operator can configure the platform to add the custom certificates into the application container. For more information, see [Configuring Trusted System Certificates for Applications](../../devguide/deploy-apps/trusted-system-certificates.html).
