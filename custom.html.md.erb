Buildpacks are a convenient way of packaging frameworks and/or runtime support for your application. Cloud Foundry comes with system buildpacks out of the box and provides an interface for developers to create custom buildpacks.

## <a id='custom-buildpacks'></a>Custom Buildpacks ##

A buildpack repository contains three main scripts, situated in a folder named `bin`.

### <a id='detect-script'></a>bin/detect ###

The `detect` script is used to determine whether or not to apply the buildpack to an application. The script is called with one argument, the `build` directory for the application. The build directory contains the files a user `cf push`ed. It returns an exit code of `0` if the buildpack is compatible with the application. In the case of System buildpacks, if the script does return `0`, it will also print the buildpack name, version and other helpful information to `STDOUT`. 

Shown below is an example `detect` script written in Ruby that checks for a Ruby application based on the existence of a `Gemfile`:

~~~ruby

#!/usr/bin/env ruby

gemfile_path = File.join ARGV[0], "Gemfile"

if File.exist?(gemfile_path)
  puts "Ruby"
  exit 0
else
  exit 1
end

~~~

Optionally, the buildpack detect script can output additional details decided by the buildpack developer. Such as buildpack versioning information, a detailed list of configured frameworks and their associated versions. The following is an example of the detailed information returned by the Java buildpack:

~~~
java-buildpack=v3.0-https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git#3bd15e1 open-jdk-jre=1.8.0_45 spring-auto-reconfiguration=1.7.0_RELEASE tomcat-access-logging-support=2.4.0_RELEASE tomcat-instance=8.0.21 tomcat-lifecycle-support=2.4.0_RELEASE ...
~~~

### <a id='compile-script'></a>bin/compile ###

The `compile` script builds a droplet by packaging the application's dependencies, assuring that the application has all the necessary components needed to run.

The script is run with two arguments, the build directory for the application and the cache directory, which is a location the buildpack can use to store assets during the build process. During the execution of the `compile` script, all output sent to `STDOUT` will be relayed via the cf CLI back to the end user. 

A simple `compile` script is shown below:

~~~ruby

#!/usr/bin/env ruby

#sync output

$stdout.sync = true

build_path = ARGV[0]
cache_path = ARGV[1]

install_ruby

private

def install_ruby
  puts "Installing Ruby"

  # !!! build tasks go here !!!
  # download ruby 
  # install ruby
end

~~~
### <a id='release-script'></a>bin/release ###

The `release` script provides feedback metadata back to Cloud Foundry indicating how the application should be executed. The script is run with one argument, the `build` directory. The script must generate a YAML file in the following format:

~~~yaml
  default_process_types:
    web: start_command.filetype
~~~

`default_process_types` indicates the type of application being run and the command used to start it. At this time only `web` type of applications are supported.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To define environment variables for your buildpack, add a bash script to the <code>.profile.d</code> directory in the root folder of your application.</p>

The following example shows what a Rack application's `release` script might return:

~~~ruby

default_process_types:
  web: bundle exec rackup config.ru -p $PORT

~~~

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <code>web</code> command runs as <code>bash -c COMMAND</code> when Cloud Foundry starts your application. Refer to <a href="../devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html#start-commands">the command attribute</a> section for more information about custom start commands. </p>

## <a id='droplet-filesystem'></a> Droplet Filesystem ##

The buildpack staging process extracts the droplet into the `/home/vcap` directory inside the instance container, and creates the following filesystem tree:

```
app/ 
logs/
tmp/
staging_info.yml
```
The `app` directory contains `BUILD_DIR` contents, and `staging_info.yml` contains the staging metadata saved in the droplet.

### Partially or completely disconnected environments

Cloud Foundry buildpacks work with limited or no internet connectivity. A Cloud Foundry operator can enable the same support in
your custom buildpack by using the [Buildpack Packager](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/buildpack-packager) application.

#### Using buildpack-packager
1. Create a manifest.yml in your buildpack.
1. Run the packager in cached mode: `buildpack-packager --cached`

The packager will add (almost) everything in your buildpack directory into a zip file. It will exclude anything marked for exclusion in your manifest.

In cached mode, the packager will download and add dependencies as described in the manifest.

Option Flags

`--force-download`

By default, buildpack-packager stores the dependencies that it downloads while building a cached buildpack in a local cache at `~/.buildpack-packager`. This is in order to avoid re-downloading them when repackaging similar buildpacks. Running `buildpack-packager --cached` with the `--force-download` option will force the packager to download dependencies from the s3 host and ignore the local cache. When packaging an uncached buildpack, `--force-download` does nothing.

`--use-custom-manifest`

If you would like to include a different manifest file in your packaged buildpack, you may call buildpack-packager with the `--use-custom-manifest PATH/TO/MANIFEST.YML` option. buildpack-packager will generate a buildpack with the specified manifest. If you are building a cached buildpack, buildpack-packager will vendor dependencies from the specified manifest as well.

You can find more documentation at the [buildpack-packager Github repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/buildpack-packager).

#### Uploading the buildpack

Once you have packaged your buildpack using `buildpack-packager`, you can upload the resulting `.zip` file to your instance of Cloud Foundry:

`cf create-buildpack BUILDPACK PATH POSITION [--enable|--disable]`

## <a id='deploying-with-custom-buildpacks'></a>Deploying With a Custom Buildpack ##

Once a custom buildpack has been created and pushed to a public git repository, the git URL can be passed via the cf CLI when pushing an application.

For example, for a buildpack that has been pushed to Github:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-new-app -b git://github.com/johndoe/my-buildpack.git
</pre>

Alternatively, you can use a private git repository, with https and username/password authentication, as follows:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-new-app -b https://username:password@github.com/johndoe/my-buildpack.git
</pre>

By default, Cloud Foundry uses the default branch of the buildpack's git repository. You can specify a different branch using the git url as shown in the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-new-app -b https://github.com/johndoe/my-buildpack.git#my-branch-name
</pre>

Additionally, you can use tags or shas in a git repository, as follows:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-new-app -b https://github.com/johndoe/my-buildpack#v1.4.2
</pre>

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-new-app -b https://github.com/johndoe/my-buildpack#a2951e298bd22732fceb3968d541015120dbaf93
</pre>

The application will then be deployed to Cloud Foundry, and the buildpack will be cloned from the repository and applied to the application.

 <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If a buildpack is specified using `cf push -b` the `detect` step will be skipped and as a result, no buildpack `detect` scripts will be run.
 </p>

 <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: A common development practice for custom buildpacks is to fork existing buildpacks and sync subsequent patches from upstream. To merge upstream patches to your custom buildpack, use the approach that Github recommends for <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork">syncing a fork</a>.</p>
