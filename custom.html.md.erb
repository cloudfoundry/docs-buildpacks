This topic describes how to create custom buildpacks for <%= vars.app_runtime_first %>.

For more information about how buildpacks work, see the [Understanding Buildpacks](understand-buildpacks.html) topic.

## <a id='packaging-custom-buildpacks'></a> Package Custom Buildpacks ##

<%= vars.app_runtime %> buildpacks can work with limited or no Internet connectivity. The [Buildpack Packager](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/buildpack-packager) RubyGem gives the same flexibility to custom buildpacks, enabling them to work in partially or completely disconnected environments.

### <a id='use-buildpack-packager'></a> Use the Buildpack Packager

1. Ensure that you have installed the [Buildpack Packager](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/buildpack-packager) RubyGem.
1. Create a manifest.yml in your buildpack.
1. Run the packager in cached mode: 
  <pre class="terminal">$ buildpack-packager --cached</pre>

The packager will add (almost) everything in your buildpack directory into a zip file. It will exclude anything marked for exclusion in your manifest.

In cached mode, the packager downloads and adds dependencies as described in the manifest.

The packager has the following option flags:

* `--force-download`: By default, the packager stores the dependencies that it downloads while building a cached buildpack in a local cache at `~/.buildpack-packager`. Storing dependencies enables the packager to avoid re-downloading them when repackaging similar buildpacks. Running `buildpack-packager --cached` with the `--force-download` option forces the packager to download dependencies from the S3 host and ignore the local cache. When packaging an uncached buildpack, `--force-download` does nothing.

* `--use-custom-manifest`: To include a different manifest file in your packaged buildpack, call the packager with the `--use-custom-manifest PATH/TO/MANIFEST.YML` option. The packager generates a buildpack with the specified manifest. If you are building a cached buildpack, the packager vendors dependencies from the specified manifest as well.

For more information, see the documentation at the [Buildpack Packager Github repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/buildpack-packager).

### <a id='share-buildpack-package'></a> Use and Share the Packaged Buildpack

After you have packaged your buildpack using `buildpack-packager` you can use the resulting `.zip` file locally, or share it with others by uploading it to any network location that is accessible to the CLI. Users can then specify the buildpack with the `-b` option when they push apps. See <a href="#deploying-with-custom-buildpacks">Deploying Apps with a Custom Buildpack</a> for details.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Offline buildpack packages may contain proprietary dependencies that require distribution licensing or export control measures. For more information about offline buildpacks, refer to <a href="depend-pkg-offline.html#offline-buildpacks">Packaging Dependencies for Offline Buildpacks</a>.</p>

### <a id='specifying-default-versions'></a> Specify a Default Version ###

As of `buildpack-packager` [version 2.3.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/buildpack-packager/releases/tag/v2.3.0), you can specify the default version for a dependency by adding a `default_versions` object to the `manifest.yml` file.
The `default_versions` object has two properties, `name` and `version`. For example:

```yml
default_versions:
- name: go
  version: 1.6.3
- name: other-dependency
  version: 1.1.1
```

To specify a default version:

1. Add the `default_version` object to your manifest, following the [rules](#rules) below. You can find a complete example manifest in the <%= vars.app_runtime %> [go-buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-buildpack/blob/f1a380f2f3a8012491c6007948af74676713dd50/manifest.yml) repository. 

1. Run the `default_version_for` script from the [compile-extensions](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/compile-extensions) repository, passing the path of your `manifest.yml` and the dependency name as arguments. The following command uses the example manifest from step 1:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ ./compile-extensions/bin/default\_version\_for manifest.yml go 1.6.3
  </pre>

#### Rules for Specifying a Default Version

The `buildpack-packager` script validates this object according to the following rules:

* You can create at most one entry under `default_versions` for a single dependency. The following example causes `buildpack-packager` to fail with an error because the manifest specifies two default versions for the same `go` dependency.

    ```yml
    # Incorrect; will fail to package
    default_versions:
    - name: go
      version: 1.6.3
    - name: go
      version: 1.7.5
    ```

* If you specify a `default_version` for a dependency, you must also list that dependency and version under the `dependencies` section of the manifest. The following example causes `buildpack-packager` to fail with an error because the manifest specifies `version: 1.9.2` for the `go` dependency, but lists `version: 1.7.5` under `dependencies`. 

    ```yml
    # Incorrect; will fail to package
    default_versions:
    - name: go
      version: 1.9.2

    dependencies:
    - name: go
      version: 1.7.5
      uri: https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.7.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
      md5: c8cb76e2308c792e2705c2eb1b55de95
      cf_stacks:
      - cflinuxfs2
     ```

##<a id='contract'></a> Core Buildpack Communication Contract

This section describes the communication contract followed by the <%= vars.app_runtime %> core buildpacks. This contract enables buildpacks to interact with one another, so that developers can use multiple buildpacks with their applications.

Buildpack developers must ensure their custom buildpacks follow the contract.

This section uses the following placeholders:

* `IDX` is the zero-padded index matching the position of the buildpack in the priority list.
* `MD5` is the MD5 checksum of the buildpack's URL. 

For all buildpacks that supply dependencies via `/bin/supply`:

* The buildpack must create `/tmp/deps/IDX/config.yml` to provide a name to subsequent buildpacks. This file may also contain miscellaneous configuration for subsequent buildpacks.
* The `config.yml` file should be formatted as follows, replacing `BUILDPACK` with the name of the buildpack providing dependencies and `YAML-OBJECT` with the YAML object that contains buildpack-specific configuration:
	```
	name: BUILDPACK
	config: YAML-OBJECT
	```
* The following directories may be created inside of /tmp/deps/IDX/ to provide dependencies to subsequent buildpacks:
	* `/bin`: Contains binaries intended for $PATH during staging and launch
	* `/lib`: Contains libraries intended for $LD_LIBRARY_PATH during staging and launch
	* `/include`: Contains header files intended for compilation during staging
	* `/pkgconfig`: Contains `pkgconfig` files intended for compilation during staging
	* `/env`: Contains environment vars intended for staging, loaded as `FILENAME=FILECONTENTS`
	* `/profile.d`: Contains scripts intended for `/app/.profile.d`, sourced before launch
* The buildpack may make use of previous non-final buildpacks by scanning `/tmp/deps/` for index-named directories containing `config.yml`.

For the last buildpack:

* To make use of dependencies provided by the previously applied buildpacks, the last buildpack must scan `/tmp/deps/` for index-named directories containing `config.yml.` 
* To make use of dependencies provided by previous buildpacks, the last buildpack:
	* May use `/bin` during staging, or make it available in $PATH during launch
	* May use `/lib` during staging, or make it available in $LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH during launch
	* May use `/include`, `/pkgconfig`, or `/env` during staging
	* May copy files from `/profile.d` to `/tmp/app/.profile.d` during staging
	* May use the supplied config object in `config.yml` during the staging process

## <a id='deploying-with-custom-buildpacks'></a>Deploy Apps with a Custom Buildpack ##

Once a custom buildpack has been created and pushed to a public git repository, the git URL can be passed via the cf CLI when pushing an app.

For example, for a buildpack that has been pushed to Github:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-new-app -b git://github.com/johndoe/my-buildpack.git
</pre>

Alternatively, you can use a private git repository, with https and username/password authentication, as follows:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-new-app -b https://username:password@github.com/johndoe/my-buildpack.git
</pre>

By default, <%= vars.app_runtime %> uses the default branch of the buildpack's git repository. You can specify a different branch using the git url as shown in the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-new-app -b https://github.com/johndoe/my-buildpack.git#my-branch-name
</pre>

Additionally, you can use tags in a git repository, as follows:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-new-app -b https://github.com/johndoe/my-buildpack#v1.4.2
</pre>

The app will then be deployed to <%= vars.app_runtime %>, and the buildpack will be cloned from the repository and applied to the app.

 <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If a buildpack is specified using `cf push -b` the `detect` step will be skipped and as a result, no buildpack `detect` scripts will be run.
 </p>

<%= vars.disable_custom %>

 <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: A common development practice for custom buildpacks is to fork existing buildpacks and sync subsequent patches from upstream. To merge upstream patches to your custom buildpack, use the approach that Github recommends for <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork">syncing a fork</a>.</p>
